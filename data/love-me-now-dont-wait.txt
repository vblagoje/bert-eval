Introduction

When I was in my English class my junior year at Redwood High School in 1962, Visalia, California, I became fascinated with Poetry.  Although I have 10 books that I’ve written and had published on both Smashwords.com/author/Ron L Carter and Amazon.com/author/Ron L Carter, I’ve always wanted to take the poems I’ve written throughout the years and put them in a book. 
Included in this collection are a few poems where I’ve written about my feelings while I was in Vietnam in 1967 and 1968. The poems are “CONFUSED,” “Circle of Life,” and “Love me Now, Don’t Wait,” from my book, “Twenty-One Months.” The poems CONFUSED and Love Me Now, Don’t Wait, received special recognition in the Veterans Voices – Summer 2016, Booklet. 
I also have a few poems that I wrote especially for a couple of my other books, such as, “From the Darkness of my Mind,” from the book with the same title and, “A Grandfather’s Revenge,” from the book, “American Terrorist – A Grandfather’s Revenge.”  The rest of the poems in this book are mostly love poems that I’ve written over the years.
Several of these poems have been made into studio recorded songs like: “Invisible to Me,” “Beautiful Weed,” “She Touched my Heart,” “Why Fight it,” “Never Going to Love Me,” “Distance,” “Circle of Life,” and “I’m Going Back to Caddo Gap.”

Love me Now Don’t Wait

Don’t wait until my soul has left this earth

Let me steal the words, from your lips

Why wait until you see me no more
Just caress me, with your fingertips

Why tell me when I’m sleeping, to never see me again

Say the words to me, while I’m still awake

I could feel the love come from deep in your heart
And see that it wasn’t just fake

If you knew I was thirsting for a drink of water so sweet
Would you turn from me, and never bring it

The same is true of tender caresses, when
I’m at heaven’s gate

Give it now while my body still craves, it just a bit

I won’t feel your kisses in my long resting place

So, if you love me bring it now, if it’s only a little

Whisper it softly to me while I can own and treasure it
There will be plenty of time to sit and fiddle

My lonely heart is thirsting for your love,
So why wait until I’m gone to cry


Open your arms with love, while my eyes still see you
Don’t be the one that sits and asks yourself why

Once I’m gone you can speak to me only in spirit
Tell me you love me, while I can still hear it

Don’t wait until you sprinkle my ashes over the ground
Whisper softly you love me, while I’m still around


Beautiful Weed

I’ve compared you to a flowering weed
That grows in a field from just a seed

There are other plants all around
But none like you to be found

You’ve stood tall through life’s hurtful things
Like wind, rains, and storms that life brings

Now it’s easy to see, you’re no weed at all
But a beautiful Rose, that stands so tall

There have been times you staggered and almost fell
Nourished by strength, and came through it well

Sparkling skies that shine down on you
Are not black or gray, but silvery blue

You’re something special, and one of a kind
Like an uncut diamond, so hard to find

Up close its easy to see, you’re not like the rest
Cause out of them all, you’re still the best

Now it’s easy to see you’re no weed at all
But a beautiful Rose, that stands so tall

The fragrance of your body takes my breath away
Like springtime in autumn, I want you to stay

I could take you away from this field of weeds
And you wouldn’t worry about all your needs

Someday you may get weak and wither and die
But I’ll never have a reason to cry

Cause it was easy to see, you were no weed at all
But a beautiful Rose, that stands so tall



She Touched my Heart

Ouch--she touched my heart

Just like in the movie ET
 She really got to me

Ouch –she touched my heart

I'm talking about a girl I know
With blond hair a glow

She's so beautiful, but shy, and
Doesn't understand why

She makes me weak in the knees
And tremble like the trees

I keep saying to myself

Ouch--she touched my heart

Just like in the movie ET

She really got to me, ouch --she touched my heart

When I first saw her, I knew it wasn't right
But I just wanted to hold her tight

Now she gives her love so free
And it's only for me

She makes my heart sing
And my fingers ting

I keep saying to myself --

Ouch--she touched my heart

Just like in the movie ET
She really got to me


Invisible to Me

I hear her voice, but I can’t see her
call her name but she doesn’t answer

I’m looking in every room as I go
and its deafening, you know

I search every corner of the room
but the silence is like a tomb

She’s invisible to me, nothing left but a memory

She’s just a ghost in my mind 

Just a ghost in my mind

I see her dancing through my head
Just like the day we first wed

I reach out for her but she’s not there
Love to kiss her if I only dare

Then I awake from the sweet dream
And reality hits me like a beam

I call out her name in hope she will hear me
Oh God! Where can she be

I lie down in bed to try and go to sleep
But thoughts are engraved so deep

I wish I could feel and see her just one last time
I’d tell her she was the best friend of mine

Then she touches me and wakes me from my sleep

I’m startled and leap to my feet

She’s standing right in front of me with a smile on her face
But it’s not her, it’s just an outline, and a trace

She’s invisible to me, nothing left but a memory

She’s just a ghost in my mind
Just a ghost in my mind


Whispering Thoughts of You

I lie awake, with thoughts of you on my mind
So precious you are, so hard to find

You’re so beautiful with your hair of glow
It makes me shiver, from head to toe

Those big blue eyes drive me insane
To touch you, I can hardly refrain

That smile, so kind, gentle, and shy
Makes me happy to be your guy

Your body is so tender, it drives me wild
I get weak in the knees, like a child

So soft and luscious are those sweet lips
To kiss them takes me on trips

But none of those compare to your most precious part
Which is your compassionate soul, and loving heart

I will always treasure you, for the person you are
And you will always be my shining star

These things I’ve tried to say to you aloud
But I’m keeping them under our cloud

Wherever you go, I will always be with you
Maybe only in spirit, with a love so true

If you listen so quietly, you can hear me say
Hi! sweetheart, how was your day

So, if you lie away awake, and think of me too
Listen for my whispering, thoughts of you


When Two Hearts Meet

Love is so precious when two hearts meet
and loving you sweeps me off my feet

You light up my heart when I see that smile
for your love, I'd walk a mile

The thought of your touch makes me tremble and shake
almost more than I can take

Those eyes send me as you look into mine
makes me mellow, like a fine wine

When you kiss me, I tingle from my head to my toes
It’s all yesses and no more no's

As you hold me in your arms, I feel complete
life has meaning, you're so sweet

When we make love, it must be ecstasy
 knowing the love, you bring to me

Yeah, love is so precious when two hearts meet
and loving you is--Oh--so sweet

When two hearts meet, ain't it great, ain't it sweet
It puts a smile upon my face when two hearts meet


Daydreaming

Sometimes I daydream I’m still with you
Deep in thought it seems as if it’s true

I’m excited as you’re gliding over me
Holding my hand and looking so free

I try to kiss you, but you disappear
I close my eyes and fight my fear

Then you come dancing back again
Kissing me softly, Oh! it’s a sin

I’m having a daydream, a daydream of you

Coming alive, it was just us two
But it was a daydream of you

You float into my arms and make my heart skip a beat
Memories of our love are still so sweet

You were perfect and had no more pain
Squeezing my hand, driving me insane

You laughed that laugh, that I so love
Then you gave me a tender shove

Suddenly I’m right back in the present time
But still wanting that daydream of mine

I’m having a daydream, a daydream of you

Coming alive, it was just us two
But it was a daydream of you


Why Fight It

Over the beach she comes running,
Suddenly I see her face

I can’t believe my eyes,
there came old questions and whys

Like – Why can’t I still have her
Can’t there be anymore

All through the night as we tumbled
I see my face in her eyes,

My heart’s beating as if I were a child
To hold her drives me wild

I can see her now, she is gliding over me
And she whispers

Why Fight it, why fight it

I turned my face, to try and hide my guilt
Inside my heart, started to wilt

I took a step, to try and walk away
And my heart burst, with nothing to say

I can see her now, she is gliding over me
And she whispers

Why fight it, why fight it

Now that she has slowly sank in,
To my past of many beauties

I think of her tonight, longing to hold her tight

Oh – Oh – Why -- fight it

Never Going to Love Me

I never thought, I would lose you

Feel the emptiness of you never coming back
Drugs were addictive and took you off track
Depressed and wanting to die
Foolishly, I didn’t know why
I wanted to help if only I could
I was blind and never understood
I couldn’t believe you’d ever say goodbye
Thought our love was too strong to die
Loving you was like a beautiful game
With hugs and kisses, what a shame

But now you’re never going to touch me again
Like I’ve never been touched before
And you’re never going to love me
Like I’ve never been loved before

The bottle didn’t say take these if you dare
When addicted, you don’t have a care
But the pain was deep in your soul
And soon the drugs took control
You said we needed to take a break
Didn’t know my love was at stake
The break was to be only a short time away
but it turned into years and a day
You’re the one that I once did adore
Come back to me, but not anymore
The love is still there, but it’s not the same
You hurt my heart and I took the blame

I know I’m in that head of yours somewhere
Because you’ve told me you still care
Thoughts of you are of love we had
The good memories makes me sad
Hurt from losing you has now faded away
And I’m getting stronger every day
Now I think of you and there’s no pain
Thankfully, I’m not still as insane

So now I can finally say!
You’re never going to touch me
Like I’ve never been touched before
And, you’re never going to love me,
Like I’ve never been loved before


Waiting for You

Hey girl, what happened, I was waiting for you
To meet and have a drink or two

From loving each other over the years
To wondering and holding back tears

I thought everything with us was cool
Then I started to feel like a fool

I tried to call but your phone was dead
A tornado was spinning in my head

I left a message for you to call me back
But the silence threw me out of whack

So, what happened, I wish I knew
Because I was waiting for you

You cut me off Facebook and all your friends
Couldn’t even talk to make amends

It was like I was a thief trying to steal your heart
But all I wanted was the loving part

Now it’s just broken parts you left behind
I can’t believe I was so blind

I tried to find you, but no one would tell
And I just kept feeling like hell

It took three long months, but I finally found you
By then, I was crazy and wondering what to do

Then you called me and told me what went wrong
But I wish it hadn’t taken you so long

Now I’m glad I know why you did what you did
I only wish you didn’t have to keep it all hid

Now that I know I’m glad that we’re through
And I’m no longer waiting for you


Grandma

I was jogging along in the park on a pretty day
When a little old lady, got in my way

She stumbled and almost fell, right into that path of mine
I grabbed her and held her, for a moment in time

As I stood there, I said Ma’am are you okay
I wasn’t really sure, what to say

Trying to catch her breath, when she said, I think so
I was just thinking about, my husband, Joe

I picked up her fragile body and sat her on the park bench
She smiled at me, and she didn’t even flinch

Briefly she put her face in her hands and began to cry
I felt terrible, and I didn’t know why

I tried to comfort her, and she said she would be okay
I put my arm around her, and told her I would stay

We talked about things that had happened in her life
She said she was happy, being Joe’s wife

She looked up, from her somewhat familiar face
Then smiled, and gave me a huge embrace

She said, you go on ahead sonny, I’ll be fine
I just had to collect that heart of mine

She had a twinkle in her eye as I turned to leave
But upon looking back, I couldn’t believe

She had vanished and not a trace of her to be seen
She was a ghost and not a dream

As I sat back down to think about what had just happened to me

I remembered I had a Great Grandpa Joe, and Grandma Bree

They had been gone so long, I didn’t recognize her
What a beautiful gift she gave me, that’s for sure


The One I Could Never Forget

Of all the beautiful girls I’ve known in my life
Her love’s the one that cut me like a knife

I could just never get her out of my head
Maybe it was the things she said

When she touched me, it made me feel complete

For her love, I’d fall at her feet

You never know what you have until its gone
Wishing her love, you could’ve won

Sometimes I would drive past her home
And imagined us just being alone

If I had the guts, I’d confront her, and tell her how I feel

But I’m a coward, and don’t have the will

I hurt her heart the last time I talked with her
Didn’t realize how much in love we were

Now I’m afraid to face, and tell her how I feel

That love for her is still deep and real

She would probably slap my face or curse me out

And I would deserve it, no doubt

I should just go up to her and tell her I still care

And with her, my life, I want to share

I wish my heart could do that, but pride gets in the way

So, I guess, she will always be, the one that got away


Mother

Mother, oh mother, what can we all say
Except, we love you in every way

Thank you for giving up all your hopes and dreams
To become our mother in your teens

At only sixteen you had your first child
With seven more to come that was wild

Now you have five boys and three girls
But no diamonds, lace, or fancy pearls

Although we had no money, we still weren’t poor
Our love for each other, was worth a lot more

You guided our lives and showed us the way
How to love Jesus and how to pray

Through all these years we depended on you
Now we’re all grown so, thanks for that too

As you get old and think we don’t care
Just read this poem, that we all share

For you’re our mother, and we just want you to know
That we love you, with all our hearts and soul


Love Gone Bad

You can’t make someone love you if they don’t
Try as you may, they just won’t

Sadness and wishing something could be
Changes nothing when she wants to be free

You punish yourself, for the things she says you done
Making you squirm is part of her fun

Wish all you may that life will turn around
But once love is lost, it can never be found

Don’t look back on a love gone bad
You won’t always be so sad

You forsake all your pride just to get her back
For will of trying, you’ll never lack

You beg that she would give you one last chance

All in vain, cause she’s taken her stance

Cry as you must when you go to bed at night
Pain is temporary, but it’s still a fight

Don’t look back in your new journey of life
Someday you’ll have a new love, and wife

As much as it hurts now, and you’re feeling sad
One day you’ll forget, the love gone bad


The Distance

I lived here and she lived there
And first I didn’t really care

Then our life began, and we started having fun
Hanging out at the beach and taking in the sun

Drinking shots, and getting high with friends
Smoking a doobie until nobody wins

But then I started fighting the – distance
The miles apart created such resistance

I never thought it would be so hard
But the distance put me on guard

Then we started getting serious about each other
And I wanted to introduce her to my mother

I was driving three hours to share the love I would give
Until we began fighting, about where we should live

I was stubborn about it and so was she
It wasn’t long and we were soon free

I still have memories of the girl I used to covet
But now I can surf, snowboard, and I love it

No more do I have to worry about the resistance
Cause we couldn’t take our love the distance


I’m Sorry

We’d been together since we were both real young
“Just Breathe” was Our song that Faith once sung

I was working hard to make a living way into the night
And didn’t even notice that you had become up tight

You started to change and wouldn’t laugh at my jokes anymore
I would come home and flop on the couch and you, ignore

Then I noticed that you were on the phone all the time
Thought it was just a friend of yours on the line

I didn’t know it was an old high school boyfriend
For me, it was the beginning of the end

I came home one day, and your things were gone
Just a note on the table, that said I’m sorry Ron

I went crazy the first few months just trying to get you back
But your friend just wanted you in his sack

He must have been smooth and knew just what to say
It broke my heart that our love didn’t keep him away

At first It drove me crazy and I kept looking for you
I was lost and didn’t know what to do

Now you tell me the grass wasn’t greener on the other side
Because you now think your friend just took you for a ride

You say you miss the life we had together
And with me you could live for ever

I’m sorry, you lost me, now you know
I’m sorry, just go


She Is

What happened to the man I use to be
I was reckless and so carefree

I would go to parties and stay out all night
But all I wanted was to hold her tight

She gave me a reason to want to live
and all my love to her I did give

So, here I am loving every inch of her
How she makes my heart purr

She is the lady, the woman in my life
She is my lover, my friend, my wife

I used to go to the bars alone and dance a slow song
pretend I was happy, even when it was all wrong

I wake in the morning and see her body next to me
it blows my mind that she gives her body so free

But for her love I just can’t get enough
moments without her are really tough

Her body is so tender I tremble at the touch
a lifetime would never be too much

I love her golden hair as it flows down her neck
to run my fingers through it makes me a wreck

And when I look in her eyes, I get lost in space
loneliness and sadness, there is not a trace

She is the lady, the woman in my life
She is my lover, my friend, my wife


Our Beautiful Love

All the brilliant stars shining above
Once did shine for me and my love

I remember that wonderful summer night
We danced, kissed and I held you tight

You were so beautiful with your big round eyes
And so kind, innocent, sweet, and wise

How feminine you looked, so lovely, gentle, and shy
It was great feeling like I was your guy

I didn’t realize how happy this world could be
Until the day God sent your love to me

Three priceless years you were faithful and true
I was young, foolish, and jealous of you

We shared each other dreams, hopes, and fears
Each other’s happiness, sorrows, and tears

Marriage we had talked about, but that was all
For we both had dreams that could not fall

Relentlessly time has faded and so your love
Now you are free like the beautiful dove

Continuously you search and strive in vain
For that something you will one day claim

Forever hopelessly I think and dream of you
Your love has died, and my heart has too

I know that one day I will think of you no more
You will be married, and your husband adore

But I will always remember the stars above
That once did shine for me and my love


Young Love

The first time I saw you with the ribbon in your hair
I knew you were something special, beyond compare

Your blue eyes were like magnets that drew me in
To a world of love and that’s how it begin

We were both so young and so full of life
You fulfilled my dreams when you became my wife

I know I took you away from life at its prime
And youth only come along once in a lifetime

I hope you forgive me for that someday
But love is blind, and it stood in my way

At times I’ve hurt you when I never meant too
But remember that I’ll always love you

Thank you for giving me the greatest you could give
And most of all, a reason to live

We’ve had great times together, you and I
We’ll remember until the day we die

Through the years I’ve loved you very much
Even still, I thrill at your loving touch

I hope that you believe me when I say
I love you; I love you, in every way


Would You do it all Again

It had been a long time, but I saw her today
and I had some things I wanted to say

I asked her - If you could do it all again,
would you do it all again

Would you laugh at me, would you make me cry
Break my heart and let our love die

She turned, looked at me, and tried to walk on by
I reached out to her hand to say good-bye

She had tears in her big green eyes
As she said to my surprise

If I could do it all again, I wouldn't do it all again

I wouldn't laugh at you, or make you cry
I wouldn't break your heart, and let our love die

I was shocked and didn't know what to say
I didn’t expect it to come out that way

She then asked me the same thing again
When I realized what a fool, I had been

She said, if you could do it all again, would you do it all again

Would you laugh at me, would you make me cry
Break my heart and, let our love die

With her hand in mine, I said, I still love you and if I
could do it again I would do it again

Except I wouldn’t laugh at you, and make you cry
break your heart, and let our love die


Love Hurts

Through the consciousness of my brain
I tried to shift through the pain

I wanted to try and make sense of it all
Maybe I just needed to take a fall

Las night my heart hurt so bad that I cried
And it came from deep inside

I tossed and turned all through the night
Within my soul, I was having a fight

Which way to turn is driving me crazy
The entire world seems a little hazy

She says she loves me, but hates me too
Thoughts of love is becoming few

I was programmed to work late into the night
And never dreamed it could cause a fight

My greatest thrill was having kids of my own
I never thought we would throw a stone

Years of fighting has calloused my heart
We are no longer one, but apart

Most people would’ve given this up long ago
We were gluten for punishment is all I know

For love is not like this and we’re way off track
Even so, I still wish I had it all back

I long for that feeling that I once knew
When love was just brand new

I want to laugh and joke and be happy again
To have a new life that will be sane

A woman beside me that will be happy in heaven above
I long for that person to cherish and love

I don’t want to hurt from deep in my heart anymore
Please send me a person that I will adore

I have to be able to trust her with my heart and soul
Never cheat or leave me, but love me whole


Strong Love

I first saw her at my niece’s birthday party
I was teasing her and acting like a smarty

Her hair was in ponytails on each side of her head
And I wasn’t thinking about what I said

I told her how pretty she was, and she started to cry
I said I’m sorry and she said it’s ok, I’m just shy

I didn’t see her again until ten years later
She asked me if I wanted to date her

We spent time together and kissed during the night
But the time for dating just wasn’t right

Took her home early in the morning hours
Never even sent her flowers

It was a Sweet love, strong love

Thought we could make it through the tears
And beat the odds of the years

Didn’t see her again for another twelve years
We talked and kissed and had a few beers

It was at my brother’s house on New Year’s Eve
Once I saw her, I never wanted her to leave

After that day we couldn’t leave each other’s side
I just wanted to make her my bride

From that day forward nobody could keep us apart
There was no limits to the love in our heart

Fifteen years we loved each other true
I would tell her there’s none like you

We had a good life and things were good
You don’t change that even if you could

I thought we could make it through the tears
And beat the odds of the years

Then things changed and so did our life
She no longer wanted to be my wife

Leaving me with no forwarding address
Feeling like a fool I was a mess

Years passed and so the love we once did share
I think of the girl with ponytails in her hair

It was supposed to be a sweet love, strong love

But we couldn’t make it through the tears
And we couldn’t beat the odds of the years


Behind the Glass Door

I still drive by the big old house that we once shared
And flash back to the days when you still cared

I feel empty and I get weak in the knees
I can’t believe the size of those trees

She put her prints in the concrete of the circle drive
I believe she was only around five

Drifting back, my mind can’t forget the past
And how time went by, way too fast

The house is still there, but it’s not a home anymore
Just a shell of memories, behind the glass door

We had a good life that was filled with lots of love
We felt free there, just like all our dove

I thought we were happy, and didn’t know you were crying
And Inside, you must have been dying

Things from the past destroyed us, right from the start
I was hoping our love, would heal your heart

The house is still there but, it’s not a home anymore
Just a shell of memories behind the glass door

I buried our old Heather in the field out back
When she got ran over for venturing off track

I used to sing “My Girl,” when I took her to school
Sometimes she would cry, I was such a fool

I still see her riding on the mowing tractor with me
Smiling and laughing and happy as can be

I hope whatever plagued you is no longer part of your life
And finally, you can be free, of all of that strife

Though we’re not together for the past several years
I’m happy that time, has dried up my tears

The house is still there but, it’s not a home anymore
Just a shell of memories, behind the glass door


Life Goes On

After all this time it’s hard to smother the love
From your heart you push and shove

You rack your brain to try and figure it out
But it’s deep in your soul, no doubt

You go to bed, but you still can’t sleep
Thoughts of her are cut so deep

With new loves you wake. toss and turn
Open your eyes, then crash and burn

Looking at her pictures you wonder if you’re that weak
You really don’t want a love that makes you so meek

Now you realize maybe it wasn’t that real at all
Believing that, helps you take the fall

Being in love is being with each other through thick and thin
And not giving up when the hard times begin

I’m thankful now in a lot of ways, for what has become a test
I realize wanting someone may not always be for the best

Looking back, you feel good about giving it all you had
No more sorrows or feelings of sad

Sometimes people in our lives just aren’t meant to be
But loneliness also comes with being free

You just keep moving forward and life goes on
Through it all you can say you won


Nobody Okie Boy

Just turned sixteen and still in school
bought my own car and I was no fool

I met her at the Saturday night dance
we liked each other at first glance

We danced and kissed and held each other tight
She said let’s go out next Friday night

I pulled up in my old 49 ford and walked to the door
with the Rose in my hand and my pride a soar

Then her dad met me out front and said

My daughter doesn’t go out with a nobody okie boy like you
And I said, sir, I aint an okie boy, I’ll be a somebody one day

I promise I’ll be a somebody some day

It was the first time I realized I was poor
and I swore it would happen no more

A few years passed and I saw her in college
by then I gained a great deal of knowledge

She asked me if I could please take her out on Friday night
and I said yes, that would be alright

That Friday night came and went
but with her it was never spent

I couldn’t forget the words her dad said to me

My daughter doesn’t go out with a nobody okie boy like you
and I said, sir, I aint an okie boy, I’ll be a somebody one day

I promise I’ll be a somebody some day

I still hear myself saying aloud,
I aint a nobody okie boy, I’ll be a somebody one day

I aint an okie boy


Circle of Life

Born into the world without a fear
Learning to walk at one year

Memories of parents in the early days
Is of the love given in many ways

Through the years we adjust to many things
Happiness, sorrow, and pain, life brings

First here and gone, then it comes back again
It’s the circle of life, where it all began

As time passes, we become tall
During our teens, life is a ball

Parents love is far and starts drifting away
We meet someone and marry one day

As life goes one, we become old
With a child of our own to hold

As fate remains and we keep living on
Thoughts of parents are of them gone

Someday we grow old, weak, and tired
As our children are proud of what they have sired

The circle of life remains, and life is repeated
It would be sad if it were all deleted


Lost Friend

Dear God, what happened to the person we both used to know
Did he want to leave you, or just have to go

He used to love You, and lived his life that way
He still loves You, but he’s gone astray

Compassion he possessed throughout his heart and mind
But now only a trinkle he can find

Happiness and love, from his body, once did flow
He used to laugh and joke, and was never low

How naïve he was about the world around
then he awoke and wished could be found

Sometimes he wonders if he wasn’t better that way
He had less troubles, than he does today

Trials and tribulations, we will all one day pay
Your word was written, in the Bible, they say

This must be those days for he sure is off track
And only You, God, can bring him back

So, if you see my lost friend, would You bring him back again
So, his life can end, where it once began



Friendships, Love, and Memories

Sometimes life is not always what it may appear to be
Like friendship, love or even a memory

So many times, we want things to be just our own way
Until we find out that life will come what may

We may cry and sob, but still do not understand
Teardrops of pain, is like a trinkle of sand

The friendship you know are not always the lasting kind
Because true friends are so hard to find

So, if you find that true friend that you can trust
Don’t let it tarnish or every turn to rust

Love is something I believe may be just a state of mind
Coming along seldom during your lifetime

When you have been hit by love you don’t doubt the feeling
To the highest glory you’re sent a reeling

You laugh and kiss and are on top of the world
Into the heights of ecstasy, you are hurled

Memories are the bad and good in all of us
And we think back and make such a fuss

Some are happy, others are sad, yet others just make you mad
But memories should make you glad

They shape our destiny and the way we live
Embedded in your mind, they won’t give

These are things that control our lives and state of mind
If lucky, contentment out of the three we will find

So, when we look at life and what it may appear to be
Think about our feelings of the three



The Lonely Soul

Sometimes I just lay here and think of my life
And wonder why it’s been so full of strife

I try to live my life as best I can
But I’m merely just a man

I can’t go to sleep, I toss and turn
Inside my heart, it does yearn

For true love I hope I will know
But feelings will come and go

At times I’m happy as happy can be
Yet, other when I’m lonely as a tree

I go to work to take my mind off the fighting things
Inside my head plays games till it rings

There are times I say things I really don’t mean
I must be the craziest person you’ve ever seen

I am jealous of the people that I love the most
Maybe it would be better if I were a ghost

I can never trust anyone with my heart
They let me down right from the start

I’m surrounded by people that say they love me
But they’re not as sincere as they should be

I’m not as depressed as you might think
My heart just needs a refreshing drink

We all go through those sad mood swings
Ups and downs that life brings

I know I’ll be stronger tomorrow when I awake
To find this entire life was not a mistake


I’m Going Back to Caddo Gap


Someday --- I'm going to go back
to the place they call - Caddo Gap

In the hills near Hot Springs
where people don't sweat the small things

The women are so beautiful and shy
and they don't ever ask you why

their lips will make you weak,
like the water in Buttermilk creek

Some say you can lose your life in Bear Den Hollow
just take my word and don't dare to follow

Life is so peaceful from Round Top Mountain
You might think you found the fountain

It's where Desoto took his last stand
and the Indians won back their land

If you ever go looking for the Ridge
you can't miss old Swinging Bridge

It's where men are men and boys are boys
they have guns instead of toys

They love their country and will fight to defend
even if their life comes to an end

Raccoons they hunt way into the night
with Red Tick hounds and a flashlight

It makes me crave for that simple life
with a little house and an Arkansas wife


FROM the DARKNESS
of my MIND

Deep in my mind the lightning will strike
I ramble and rage to find what I like

Quivers of time bounce around until they meet
I stumble and fall and leap to my feet

The blood of my love drains from my heart
Withers of pain like a work of art

Love once flowed from my body and soul
But broken halves don’t make a whole

I’ll forever seek and hope someday I’ll find
That love isn’t just a state of mind

Overcome by trivialities my brain manifests
I’ll find out when I’m laid to rest


A Grandfather’s Revenge

You terrorist have spread your fear throughout the land
And made men tremble in fear, all from your hand

In the name of “Allah” and that’s what you believe
Why are all you terrorists, so naïve

Why do you hide behind the Qur’an to fit your own needs
Spreading fear and hatred, with all your dirty deeds

The Qur’an doesn’t say to kill the Christian and Jew
You extremists twisted it, to fit your point of view

You should never have killed my most precious grandson
You’ll find your time on earth, is all but done

I’ll hunt you down in the little camps where you hide
You’re nothing but cowards, with unjustified pride

You’ve created the I.E.D. bombs to kill and maim
I’ll find you and kill you, at your own game

You’ll be crying for mercy when I hunt you down
Hoping that somewhere, you have a crown

I’ll blow you to pieces by the time I’m through
Praying to Allah, that’s my promise to you



CONFUSED

My mind is confused about this world today
What is life, must it be this way

Young men are dying for us and what seems so right
Could it be a dream that will pass in the night?

It isn’t a dream for it is real and it hurts so bad
It is truly the worse troubles our world has had

Back home they have forgotten what it is all about
They are saying, Americans, let’s get out

Each day is lonely, and death fills the sky
I look toward heaven and wonder why

Yet, they are happy, as if they don’t know
They laugh, their spirits are never low

I will say a prayer for my friend that took his last breath
He wasn’t afraid to fight even till his death

They will go to parties and grow their hair long
Burn their draft cards and play a fast song

Tomorrow I will write a letter of sympathy to a man’s next of kin
It will tell how brave he was in his courage to win

They carry their signs and protest the war
It is their freedom men’s lives pay for

Often, I think that it is all in vain
That we fight and never gain

I suppose they are afraid so why go along
Are they right, and I that is wrong

Therefore, I am so confused and don’t understand
I’ll just have to ask God to give me a hand


Just a bad Dream

Twelve months is a long time when you’re all alone
But even longer when you’re so far from home

I looked the Demon in the face, as it tried hard to take control
I saw its spirit, but it disappeared when I said no

Along my journey, I thought the war was a bad dream
But things are never as easy as they seem

While there, time crept by so slowly that I felt like I was asleep
Those memories are engrained in my mind so deep

Can someone wake me from this most horrible thing
That death and destruction which war months bring

Facing demons, I said don’t try to possess me because I won’t obey
Even though my body was weak, my soul said, get away

During those times, my heart was with God from up above
And I knew he would never abandon his love

Acting like a man, I tried to keep from
crying
But tears of pain won out with all the dying

God says we’ll be met with HIS open and loving arms
And be blessed with His tender charms

We’ll walk together down that heaven path
Holding hands and not facing any wrath

He said He promises us all His help from above
With undying sympathy and abundant love

He never said it would be easy along the way
We have pain and sorrow, we all must pay

Thank you, God, for watching over me through the years
And waking me from all my fears

For helping me realize it wasn’t something I dreamed
But part of my life, just as it seemed


Remembering You

We remember the first time we saw you standing there
So beautiful you were with you long dark hair

You were so young, precious and a little shy
But you still had that twinkle in your eye

Those brown eyes fit you to a perfect tee
You were special, it was plain to see

Not only was your beauty inside and out
But more came from within, no doubt

We had fun at the Racquet Club keeping in shape
Sometimes we felt like just going ape

We had a lot of good times skiing together down the hill
You loved the stories, even if they weren’t real

We watched you struggle through the teenage years
To finally conquer most of your fears

Your faith in God became very strong
And you found peace where you belong

You were like a daughter to all of us
Sometimes we made such a fuss

We loved that smile that made everyone feel good
You would make the world laugh if you could

You were so happy and upbeat about things
Now you’re wearing those Angel wings

We’ll miss talking and being with you
But someday we’ll be with you too

So please make a place for us at God’s feet
And pray for us until we all meet


He’s Gone, but not Forgotten

We can’t change the things we wished we could
But, God, how we wish we understood

Inside this heart of mine is hurting today
For the baby boy has passed away

I know he is in a much better place than you or I
But that doesn’t stop me from wanting to cry

I wish I could’ve known him for at least a while
If only it would have been to see him smile

Maybe there’s a reason things turned out this way
No pain or suffering did he have to pay

I know he loves us as much as we love he
His mom, dad, and you and me

Throughout the coming years he will be truly missed
Someday we’ll see him because we are on God’s list

What a treasure we will find at Heaven’s Gate
With open arms, we can hardly wait



Here was a Man

Here was a man that touched upon all our lives
Made us happy and it brought tears to our eyes

He seemed to always give and never ask in return
To think about him now makes your heart yearn

Love and kindness from his heart did flow
Such was the man we all came to know

I never heard him say a harsh word to a soul
When it came to temper, he had great control
He was a man you couldn’t help but to respect
With gentleness, kindness, he had an effect

The love he had was for his loved ones and wife
And his Grandson was the joy of his life

For he cherished them all as much as any man could
What more could he have asked for, life was good

He must have been happy for he left this world content
There wasn’t even any pain the day he went

Although we didn’t see him as much as we should
Love and friendship, I know he understood

When I think about him now, I can never be sad
Having known a man like him makes you glad

For here was a man we’ll always cherish and love



Hey, What Happened to You

Hey, hey what happened to you
We were having fun at the private Hollywood club
For members only so we didn’t see the rub,

We paid the doorman a hundred bucks to let us in
And we knew we’d never be back again

Although movie stars were all around
You were nowhere to be found

We found you crawling across the dance floor
You said you were looking for the door

We propped you up against an eight by eight beam
One too many Tequila’s, you couldn’t even scream

Then you ended up doing it again, oh please
Crawling along on your hands and knees

You spilled a drink on the movie stars dress and white gloves
Even on my boots when she gave me a few shoves

She stared deep into my eyes and said are you with him
As she pulled her hand back, I said, yes ma’am I am
The bouncer came and kicked us all out for being drunk
He didn’t know we had a bottle of Tequila in our trunk

Laughing and yelling as the door closed shut
We told them all to kiss our butt

Hey, hey what happened to you
What happened to you

Nineteen Sixty-Three

It was the long hot summer of 1963
brother Jim, Bennie, and me

In high school we were chasing girls, and having a ball
Thinking we were invincible, we tried it all,

Bennie wanted to go the tough guy way
Talking softly, and fighting everyday

He was stealing gas from the farmers at night
Something that made Jim and I uptight

We broke the boards on the jute box at the burger stand
Just to be woken up at midnight to face the man
We threw Bennie in the ditch thinking he couldn’t swim
Mistakenly thinking the joke would be on him

Frantically we searched and found him hiding in the weeds
That was just some of our funny deeds

Shotgun Effie shot Bennie in the back for stealing peaches from her trees
And the pellets from the shot brought him to his knees

Lucky for him, she shot him with rock salt pelts
But screaming, it still left huge welts

Jim and I got smarter as we got older
But Bennie just kept getting bolder

From stealing hubcaps and telling us what he’d done
Like, throwing them in the river, just for fun

He never learned from those childhood pranks
He didn’t live long with all of his mistakes

I’ll never forget the long hot summer of 1963
With brother Jim, Bennie, and me
