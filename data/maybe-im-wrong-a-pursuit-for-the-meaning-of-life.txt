Prologue
Have you had the feeling that 2020 was an odd year? Things were strange, out of the ordinary, people were behaving weirdly, and nothing made much sense? If you felt this way, welcome to the club. I would like to invite you to read about my personal story, particularly what happened in 2020. I felt helpless, lost, fought with friends and family, was accused of being radical, but I can say there was a happy ending. For me, at least. I don’t consider this a spoiler. It’s like one of those opening scenes in episodes from streaming platforms that give away some but not all information. 
The year 2020 will enter history as one of the most challenging and revolutionising years in the history of humankind. People displayed signs of pessimism, fear, anger, hatred, and despair. Most of us felt perplexed with the behaviour of some people who have different ideologies. In a new era of high connectivity and easily accessible information, some people fell prey to quick conclusions and shallow thinking. To some extent, most of us did it, too, to a certain degree. Some of us rushed to conclusions without a more in-depth reflection on some matters. And some of us even accepted to promote minor injustices to defend our ideology. Humans have behaved in unexplainable ways many times throughout history. Many injustices have been boosted by large populations, including crimes against numerous minorities. How can we come together and prevent injustices? Honest and purposeful debates and critical thinking are two fundamental tools in the process. But there are other easy ways to remember rules that may help us in the challenging task of avoiding unnecessary confrontation. And if we have learned anything, we may even make recommendations, predictions to validate our model. Critical thinking will be a powerful ally in the process. 
Chapter 1. Setting the Stage
The story I am about to share starts in mid-March of 2020. At the time, I was a 38-year old Latin American expat living in a major city in Oceania. Let me give more information about me. I was born in a midsize town. I studied medicine from 1999 until 2004 and then specialised in general surgery up to 2009. During the first years of my career, I worked long shifts, which left me only a few hours to spend with my family. In 2014, due to increasing criminality rates, we decided it was time to take our kids (ages 5 and 2 at the time) and leave the country. We wanted to pursue a country where we could enjoy more freedom and less injustice. We were concerned not only with the rising criminality rates but with the deterioration of educational institutions. We feared there would be fewer good educational opportunities for the kids. It took us just over a year to plan the details of the exit, but by the end of 2015, we were on the road. We spent almost a year travelling the world, having visited thirteen countries. In October 2016, Oceania, on the other side of the world, the most recent continent colonized by men. A place we have been calling home for the past four years.
Living in a foreign country is a fantastic experience. It provides the opportunity to discover a new culture, explore positive its aspects while maintaining positive cultural norms of the country where you were born and raised. It is a win-win situation. If I am honest, I must say it comes with some challenges, like being away from friends and family. In a sense, our family pioneered the shift of most of our conversations to texts and video conferences, way before most of the world. 
In 2017 I studied full time towards a postgraduate diploma in business. It was an opportunity to expand my knowledge of business and economics. But I also had plenty of free time, which I utilised mostly to read and watch videos on subjects I was interested in, which included economics, business, and politics, to name a few. In 2018, I dedicated most of my time to obtain the residence visa, which took a bit longer than I anticipated. In 2019, I studied towards my master’s degree in health sciences. 
I must admit I spent a considerable amount of time watching videos recommended by the algorithm of a major platform, and I found fascinating concepts I had no idea existed. Most of the time, I watched TED talks, as well as other science-related content. I regularly shared them with friends and family. Most of the time, I received no feedback, probably because the lectures were too long and most people skipped watching them altogether, but occasionally I had to deal with some criticism. 
Some people believe meeting an old friend is a fantastic experience because our minds subconsciously have the opportunity to check how much that person has changed since the last time we last saw them. We also have the chance to show how we have changed or remained the same person. It is exciting because sometimes it positively surprises us, sometimes it frustrates us. And sometimes it just feels good to know the person hasn’t changed a thing, and we can still maintain the (good) memories we share and how we see them.
These episodes in which I was criticised for having a different opinion, or sometimes for just sharing a video discussing a particular topic which was sensitive for them, were an initial signal I confess I failed to notice. 
Chapter 2. A novel virus
In mid-March 2020, the COVID-19 infection, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was all over the news. We started to see people advocating for the strategy of flattening the curve. If you lived on planet Earth in 2020, you probably did not miss it. I must admit I was an enthusiast for the first three days. I even shared a post on a major social media platform, even though I never post anything. And here comes the beauty of the algorithms used by social media. Considering that I had previous interest in topics like investing and economics, for some reason I may have been suggested to watch videos from libertarian creators, and I received information that enabled me to do my own research and realise the “flatten the curve” strategy was doomed to fail. I started trying to share my thoughts with friends and family, but the level of uncertainty was too great at the time. Nobody was sure about anything, most of them were shocked by the news, and most people decided to embrace safety rather than take the risk. 
I urge the reader not to misinterpret me. I acknowledge COVID-19 is real, it has taken the lives of many people, and every loss is irreplaceable. I send my thoughts and prayers for all people who lost a family member or a friend. But I consider it unethical to employ precious resources to mitigate the effects of a relatively mild disease at the expense of other conditions that pose a considerable threat in terms of morbidity and mortality. 
It may be evident by now, but at the time very few people did the following math: 
By the 3rd of March, the epidemic phase of the disease was almost over. The outbreak was restricted to the Hubei province. The total number of fatal victims of COVID-19 in China by the 3rd of March was 2981. The number of confirmed cases was 80,270. The population of the province was close to 60 million people. There are two distinct ways of looking at the data. You can either calculate the case fatality rate (CFR) which is the number of fatal victims divided by the number of confirmed cases, which is 3.71%. Another strategy would be to assume that the crisis was over. You then calculate the mortality rate by dividing the number of fatal victims by the population of the province, resulting in less than 0.005%. There is a 7,400-fold difference between the two approaches. Which number is closer to the truth? The first strategy focuses on the number of confirmed cases, ignoring that many people were contaminated and did not develop significant symptoms, or were not tested, despite displaying symptoms. The second approach focuses on the overall population, ignoring the number of confirmed cases. 
These simple reflections enable us to conclude that by the first week of March, it was already possible to predict that the disease would not be as devastating as initially predicted by authorities. 
On the 16th of March, it was published the #9 Report by the Imperial College of London, titled “Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand”. The imperial college of London is part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), which is an organisation created in 2009 to deal with domestic and international catastrophes. 
The takeaway message of the report was: If nothing is done, the mortality rate will be close to 0.66% of the population of an affected region. As an example, it translates to 510,000 people in the UK or 2.2 million people in the US. Suppose we adopt the mitigation strategy (partial reduction of circulation of people). In that case, the mortality rate will be 0.33% of the population (which translates to roughly 250,000 in the UK or 1.1 million in the US). And finally, if the suppression strategy is adopted, the death toll will be much lower. However, they did not disclose their estimate at the time. On the same day, the prime minister of UK, Boris Johnson, was on board with the strategy to maintain the free circulation of people to allow the creation of herd immunity. Fast-forward nine days, he changed his mind and declared the first lockdown, on the 25th of March. Just one day after that, on the 26th of March, the Imperial College of London published the Report #12, which detailed the suppression strategy, being an abrupt reduction of the circulation of people, the so-called lockdowns). In this scenario, the mortality rate would be around 0.028%. This number translates to approximately 20,000 in the UK or 100k in the US. The authors were so confident their model would explain the evolution of the disease, they even proposed an adaptive triggering of suppression strategies, or intermittent lockdowns (Report #9).

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the suggestive adaptive triggering of suppression strategies in the UK. Lockdowns would be triggered when the number of ICU cases reached 100 in a week and cancelled when the population accepted the measures and the ICU occupancy dropped to 50 cases. The authors estimated that the policy would be enforced 2/3 of the time. Weekly ICU incidence is shown in red, policy triggering in purple.

On the 24th of March, researchers from the University of Oxford released a study estimating up to 50% of the UK population had already been exposed to the virus at the time. Hence, immunity was already gradually being built.
On the 17th of April, researchers from Stanford University published a study estimating the number of infected people to be between 48 and 81 times higher than the number of officially confirmed cases. 
On the 20th of April, researchers from the University of Southern California and the Los Angeles public health department published a similar study that concluded that the number of infected people could have been 28 to 55 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. 
On the 22nd of April, the Wadsworth Center in New York announced that the number of infected people could be in the 14% range (state-wide) and 21% (in the capital). The logical interpretation is that there are in fact, more than ten times the number of confirmed cases.
On the 22nd of April, an author called Wilfried Rilley published a statistical study that concluded that lockdowns do not explain the statistical difference between states and countries that have applied policies to restrict the movement of people and those which did not. In other words, with 94% confidence, only random chance could explain the difference observed between states studied. The claim is still valid, even considering critical factors such as population density, income, ethnicity, and other relevant factors. 
On the 4th of May, I made all this information public in an article I wrote in a professional social media platform with the help of a good friend from med school. The reason behind the decision of publishing the information was to share my ideas and attract criticism from other people. It was a peculiar setting, most mainstream media journalists were saying it was once in a century event, so I felt it would be a challenging endeavour. If the proposed solution was too simplistic, maybe someone could open my eyes so I could see something that I had overlooked. It did not happen. I got just a couple of likes and nothing else, not even superficial criticism. Even the initial agreement I had with my co-author disappeared, and we agreed to disagree on the recommendations following the initial step of making the strategy public.
Before that, on the 20th of April, I had previously shared another article on the same platform. It advocated for a plan in which vulnerable people would be protected while young and healthy individuals would deliberately expose themselves to achieve herd immunity. It resembled the strategy later suggested by epidemiologists, who wrote the Great Barrington Declaration. The only difference was I proposed a stepwise approach of segments of society by age, rather than all young individuals at once. I have to say I did not receive positive feedback. Apart from a couple of friends and family members who agreed with the main ideas, most people were pessimistic. They said it was an unsolvable problem. Too many vulnerable people cohabitated homes with other younger family members. They said it would make more sense to keep everybody locked up. I also uploaded a video to a major video platform explaining the strategy five days earlier, but it did not get many views. 
On the 31st of March, I uploaded another video to the same video platform inviting people to reflect on the unintended consequences of lockdown. It did not get many views, either. 
After several attempts to get people’s attention, I realised that something was not right. People’s ability to reason and look for the unintended consequences of any public policy was totally impaired. So, I gave up. I just focused on living my life, occasionally discussing something with my close friends.
Chapter 3. Something strange
A heated debate between my friends and me took place in lengthy exchanges of messages using a popular app for almost two months. My friends used very disrespectful language and name-calling. At first, I was perplexed by the lack of reasoning and critical thinking displayed by them. The most striking thing was that they failed to provide me with good counterarguments. They did not address the main point. The best they could come with was authority arguments, ad hominem and other poor ways of debating. After being accused of being an impostor, being called many names, I decided to look for fallacious arguments. And I found this:

Figure 2. The Graham hierarchy of disagreement pyramid

Paul Graham created the hierarchy of disagreement. He illustrated it by creating a pyramid which ranks the arguments from best to worst. When you see yourself debating someone who uses the lowest levels of the pyramid as counterarguments, they probably do not have good points. Instead of refuting the central point, or at least attempting to do it, they display anger, call you names and question your authority. 
My friends started to call me “social media flat-Earther”. They did it for the fact that what I was proposing contradicted the apparent scientific consensus, just like some ignorant people still contradict the scientists by claiming the Earth is flat. I felt a bit disappointed, but not sad. Instead, I pointed out that Giordano Bruno was the first person to propose the Earth was not the centre of the universe, and the Earth orbited around the sun. He was accused of contradicting the secular authorities and was hanged and burned in 1600 in Rome, Italy. He became a symbol of free speech, but apparently, most people, including my friends, have forgotten. Most people attribute the heliocentric theory to Copernicus, whose model was not widely accepted until roughly 1700. So, what sounds like an absurd today, was the most accepted belief of the “scientific” community a mere 320 years ago.
The best way to refute someone’s claim, as hypothesised by Graham, is not censoring and tampering with evidence that contradicts one’s theory. The scientific method requires debating and producing evidence a given model explains a model more accurately. 

The scientific method
For the ones who are not familiar with the scientific method, let me explain briefly. It consists of a four-stage process in which a natural phenomenon is observed, and to understand it, proposing a model is paramount. Building the model requires the creation of a hypothesis that is confirmed by conducting an experiment in a controlled environment. Once the hypothesis is confirmed, a prediction is made. Predictions enable the scientist to ensure his model explains the phenomenon as expected. If the forecast materialises, the model is valid. If not, the scientist must re-start the process.

Figure 3. Schematic representation of the scientific model
The models proposed by the Imperial College of London failed in their predictions of the number of deaths by at least two orders of magnitude. Lockdowns did not alter the natural evolution of the disease. You will probably not read this in mainstream media headlines, but it is the hard cold truth. Therefore, scientists who are committed to finding the truth should start the process over in pursuit of a model that explains the phenomenon properly.
Nevertheless, I was not convinced yet. I thought maybe it was something particular about a novel disease. Perhaps I was missing some information. Some people hate to be right because it is hard to spot mistakes; thus, they must spend considerable energy to check their hypothesis multiple times. The human being is naturally good at spotting errors in other people’s work. That is why the scientific community values peer reviews. It is an intelligent way of producing high-quality studies. And by the way, the paper published by the Imperial College of London is not peer-reviewed or scrutinised by any scientific journal. 
I tried to find some common ground debating other subjects with my friends. Maybe there was something particular about this disease. So, I brought up a myriad of topics that people with different ideologies commonly debate, but, to my surprise, the outcome was the same. They got outraged and called me names. I will go through most subjects because I believe many people will identify with my friends or with me.  

Chapter 4. A better world
The disagreements between my friends and me seemed to be too deep to be resolved. How could we have such different opinions on basically all matters? We grew up together. We used to get along, laugh of the same jokes; we shared values. Not so long ago, we were living in the same city, going to the same places. The world is becoming globalised; it was supposed to bring people closer, not divide people who were friends for decades. I was astonished by the level of unwillingness to listen to a different opinion. So, after disagreeing on every topic I could come with, I asked them if those fundamental differences of opinions were based on our concepts of a better world. I asked them what their definition of a better world was. 
Defining outcomes is a crucial step. If we don’t know what the destination is, any road will do; or no road will be good enough, depending on one’s expectations about the destination. So, I asked what their version of a better world would look like, and nobody wanted to give me a description. Then, I came up with mine:
“A better world is a place where there are systems in place to stimulate population growth, which can be broken down into increasing life expectancy and fertility rates while preserving fundamental human rights.”
There are other forms of looking at what a good world would be. One could say: A better world is a place where people value happiness. Or a better world is a place where we live in harmony with nature. Or a better world is a place where we minimise unnecessary suffering. All these concepts may be true, but they are complicated to measure objectively. And we need to measure results if we want to evaluate if the proposed solutions are working towards our goal or against it. 
The concept of a better world I proposed seemed objective to me, something measurable, fair, and desirable. It was sustainable because it resembled the same criteria we use to determine how well other animals are doing in nature. The difference is that animals are irrational, while humans are not. This difference justifies the need for the preservation of human rights, as one may see themselves in a conflict between maximising the chances of passing on their genes and respecting other individuals. Understanding the importance of rights contributes to the ultimate goal, which is population growth.
I then invited my friends to re-examine the history of humanity by looking at the systems that revolutionised the way we live and contributed to shaping the world where we live. 

How successful are we as a species?
It is believed that life appeared on Earth about 3.5 billion years ago. Many living creatures have inhabited our planet; some of them are now extinct. Why do some species flourish while other perish? In an environment of heated debates and very little unity, is our species doomed to be auto destroyed? What is the primary motivator of humans? Reflecting on what made our species so successful is paramount to design strategies that may improve our chances of continuing with the process. This reflection will help us promote union between people and settle disputes between people with such divergent ideologies. All conflicts these days are related to human behaviour, and it is hard to determine the incentives shaping human behaviour. 
The story of the human race is fascinating. How could an animal species thrive the way humans did? We made tremendous progress in numeric terms, leaping from a few dozen individuals to almost more than 7.8 billion people in a matter of two hundred thousand years! That’s quite an achievement. No other animal species came even close to that. It may sound like a long time from the perspective of a single lifetime, but from the evolutionary standpoint, it was a blink. This astounding success raises a few questions: 
What are the reasons behind such a tremendous success of a single species?
What have we done right to accomplish this? Have we done anything wrong along the way? Humans are so different from each other. Are there some types of behaviours that improve our chances of success? 
Is there an optimal type of behaviour that can improve our chances of success from the evolutionary standpoint? What about from the moral point of view?
People have asked these questions in the past, but I would like to invite the reader to reflect on the answers, rather than accept someone’s point of view or simply ignore the issue. I personally consider the achievement of human success far too great to be overlooked. 
I want to start by present some facts regarding human evolution. These are verifiable, and even when there isn’t complete agreement between archaeologists and biologists, I believe a conclusion can be reached after careful examination of the general story of humanity. 

Evolution of the species
Darwin’s theory of evolution is the most accepted theory to explain differences between species among the scientific community. However, in a 2019 poll from the Pew Research Center in Washington, DC, only 33% of respondents said humans are derived from the natural evolution process. To 48% of respondents, an evolutionary process took place, but it was guided by God or another higher power. And to 18%, humans did not evolve and are today precisely what they looked like when they appeared on the planet. 
Regardless of the reader’s personal beliefs, it is fair to say the behaviour humans displayed some 200,000 years ago is not the same shown by humans today. I will present the most accepted description of ancient humans in the scientific community.
The Homo sapiens originated between two to three hundred thousand years ago, in Africa. At that time, there were other hominids also inhabited the Earth: Denisovans and Neanderthals. As of today, at least seven unique homo species inhabited the planet after Homo sapiens were considered a species. They may have been geographically isolated, but they coexisted in different regions at the same time. Some examples are Homo floresiensis, Homo naledi, Homo luzonensis, Homo heidelbergensis, perhaps some red deers cave people, as well as some late surviving Homo erectus. Today, the three closest species to human beings are chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas. All other hominids in between these species and us have been extinct. The differences in behaviour between theses extinct species and us may explain why they vanished the planet, and our species was able to thrive the way we did.
How did early Homo sapiens behave? When humans originated, their behaviour was similar to many other hominids that had existed and were coexisting in the planet, such as the Homo erectus, Homo habilis, Homo ergaster, Homo antecessor, Homo neanderthalensis, and Homo floresiensis. All these species were hunter-gatherers, meaning they depended on abundant natural resources to survive. The proximity to water was also a requisite. Their life expectancy was lower than three decades, and they used to live in groups of a couple of dozen people. 
It is relevant to note that these individuals’ ancestors used to live and hunt alone. Eighty-five to 90% of carnivores hunt alone. Cooperation between individuals was something developed after hundreds of thousands of years. It proved an advantageous strategy, but it also came at a cost. When animals hunt alone, they may starve for days, sometimes weeks. 
On the other hand, when they build communities, chances are at least one of them will get lucky and caught their prey once every few days, being able to share with the group. Animals have different traits, meaning their capabilities are randomly distributed across individuals. These characteristics can be considered talents. Animals have developed a variety of hunting techniques. They rely on strength, speed, endurance, intelligence, stealth, etc. If you create a large enough community, you can benefit from different talents in different scenarios. This diversity increases the chances of success in the most various and disadvantageous situations. 
Conversely, associating with other members of their species, also created some challenges. Trusting their fellows was sometimes penalised with betrayals and worse outcomes. Sometimes even death. When one member of the hunting pack was able to take advantage of the group, he could either stick to the community’s rules and share the resources, or cheat and face possible retaliation from their peers. The optimal strategy has been studied in a range of animals, from colonies of bacteria to humans. It is called game theory. 
Regardless of what other players will do, there is always an optimal strategy for each player of certain games. These games must have predefined rules, which are known to all players, and whose behaviour is guided by the maximum utility, meaning they will try to maximise their chances of success. And by success, from an evolutionary point of view, is defined as increasing the chances of survival and genetic transmission. Game theory is a fascinating subject that helps us to understand why some behaviours are ingrained as instincts in most animals, from simple bacteria to highly educated human beings.

Chapter 5. Critical Thinking
Before I continue with the history of human evolution, it is essential to define a fundamental aspect of the strategy behind the decision-making process of humans. It may not have been fully conscious, but it sure happened. It also took tens of thousands of years, but it happened. Humans, like many other animal species, were very aware of their current living conditions and weighted each modification to their behaviour carefully. When I say it may not have been conscious, it probably was not. Instead, if it were an experiment, it would be a huge and unethical social one. Some groups chose one path; others chose alternative ones. The ones who survived passed on their genes and incorporated the culture associated with the winning strategy. The ones who opted for a suboptimal strategy did not survive and therefore are not able to promote their approach.
Critical thinking is the ability to ask the right questions before adopting any new behaviour. Changes that promote significant impact should be carefully analysed before being implemented. There is a five-step process that may help to make an important decision: Formulate the question, gather the information, apply the information, evaluate the consequences, and consider alternatives.

Formulate the question
It may seem obvious to properly formulate the question, as it becomes unrealistic to answer it properly. However, sometimes we skip this step and become frustrated with the conclusion we reach by the end of the process. So, it is imperative to formulate the question precisely. As an example, let’s say someone feels like starting to do regular physical activity. The main goal was to lose weight. However, let’s say the person fails to formulate the question and starts to do whatever exercise their friends are doing. Let’s say it is resistance training (lifting weights). By lifting weights, the person may start feeling hungrier than usual and consuming a more significant number of calories and thus end up in fact gaining weight. By the end of the first year, the person may become demotivated and unable to understand the reason. Had they considered their main goal by formulating the right question, they could have reached a different outcome. Alternatively, they could have chosen to do aerobic exercises in conjunction with a low calorie or low-carbohydrate diet. There is no consensus on what type of exercise is more helpful to lose weight, and it is not clear if one particular type of activity is more likely to produce a given result. However, this is just an example of how frustrating it can be to fail to formulate the question appropriately.

Gather the information
It is also crucial to obtain reliable information. The source of information must be carefully evaluated. The information must be accurate, and the rationale behind the strategy must be logic and reproducible. One must actively look for potential biases or conflicts of interest. As an example, one may start running regularly to promote general wellbeing. They can receive biased information on the maximum recommended distance. There is no consensus on the literature, but some fitness gurus recommend keeping the average weekly mileage below 20. Let’s say this person decides to limit their weekly mileage to 15. They may fail to benefit from running their initial aspiration, let’s say, 30 miles per week; therefore, the outcome will not be the best possible. Human beings are not all alike, and some of them may feel better doing more miles per week (up to a specific limit). So, it is imperative to look for independent, accurate and logical advice when making a decision. By the way, 30 miles has been my average weekly mileage for the past eight years.

Apply the information
Fine, you have asked the right question, gathered truthful and reliable information, but does it make sense in your individual circumstance? When adopting a new behaviour, it is essential to evaluate the logic behind the recommendation—Sticking to the example of the individual who wants to exercise with the intent to lose weight. Let’s say the person can predict that resistance training will increase their calories consumption. Does it make sense to adopt this strategy if the ultimate goal was to lose weight? Perhaps it does not. So, the person may ignore the initial recommendation and look for alternatives, like combining long-distance running and a low-carbohydrate diet, for example.

Evaluate the implications
It is also called cost-opportunity, or the road not taken. Whenever we have to make a decision that will impact our lives significantly, it is recommended that we consider other alternatives, especially the second most adequate, from an economic point of view. We should compare the pros and cons of each strategy before making a final decision. As a practical example, let’s say someone is considering joining their local gym. There is a one-year minimum membership, which will cost them $ 1,000.00, which is non-refundable according to the club rules. If they decide to enrol, let’s consider the following two outcomes: they start regularly going for the whole year, or they abandon the club after the first week. If the person thinks the second outcome more likely, maybe they should seek inexpensive alternatives first, such as exercising at the park. It allows them to evaluate if they will be able to stick to the commitment to exercising regularly before signing up at the club and paying a hefty price for their misjudgement. 

 
Consider alternatives
Considering other people have already faced the same situation you are currently experiencing, and they have a similar ability to implement critical thinking, why have they picked a different route? Is their situation unique? Do they have any information you don’t? Are they following biased advice? Stop for a moment to reflect if you have failed one of the previous steps and try to understand what motivate people to behave the way they do. It is a tough challenge, but when it comes to exercising regularly or just being a couch potato, people have a myriad of different behaviours. Even highly educated people sometimes behave differently, some of them get hurt while exercising, due to overtraining, and some of them develop diseases due to their sedentary behaviour. It is good advice to stop for a moment and reflect on how people behave towards a particular issue and what motivates them. 

Establishing an objective metric for success
From the evolutionary perspective, it can be said a given animal species is successful when it is able to increase or maintain its population size across long periods. With this goal in mind, each species must adopt strategies that improve their chances of survival and transmission of genetic material. If there is one natural law that is widely accepted is the survival of the fittest. And to be considered fit, members of a given species should adopt the strategies that enable them to survive. Natural resources are scarce, and the environment is hostile. So, animals from different species must employ an optimal approach to beat the competition, obtain the resources, and endure the natural conditions. 
Humans, as any other animal, can be deemed successful thanks to evolutionary physical adaptations as well as specific behaviours that are unique to the Homo sapiens. Physical adaptations were common to many hominids, such as: being biped, having an opposing thumb, a relatively large skull and brain compared to their body size, and the ability to cool down through sweating. These characteristics alone cannot explain the fate of extinct hominids and the success of Homo sapiens. Behaviours that were unique to our species, on the other hand, can. 

The first revolution – hunting-gathering
The rise of the Homo sapiens, about 200,000 years ago marked the beginning of the hunter-gathering society. Living in small groups enabled individuals to hunt more effectively, take care of the progeny, the disabled, and the sick. It had several advantages, but some disadvantages. The risk of some member of the group cheating and hurting the whole group increased. For example, one could be tempted to eat a massive chunk of the hunt while leaving nothing for the rest. It was a trade-off. The individuals who decided to join forces were able to obtain more resources than the individuals who opted to continue the lone wolf strategy, on average. It was the first example in history of humankind of an association that led to great collective benefit while carrying a small disadvantage, and it should be acknowledged if we want to be honest. 
Another essential feature of this association was the strengthening of the hierarchy. The only way to enable such a structure was to establish an order of dominance between members. This phenomenon was observed in other “social” animals like monkeys, bees, and even carnivore animals who hunt alone, like wolves and big cats. With humans, it was not different. Hierarchical structures were not only present, but it was fundamental for the strategy to work.
Meanwhile, those Homo sapiens’ ancestors who opted not to organise themselves into small groups had, on average, fewer resources, and in an environment with finite resources, their fate was extinction. If this were an interventional study, the experiment would have to be halted because the control group would have faced a severe complication: death.
The “intervention group” used to explore the resources of a particular area. When the resources became scarce, they would migrate to an unexplored region, where they would be able to find more fruits, seeds, and animals for a few years. These cycles were consecutive, but sometimes the journey took a heavy toll on the explorers. The need for accessible water restricted the possibilities, and the competition with other groups made this strategy particularly challenging.  
The first revolution enabled not only the survival of Homo sapiens who organised themselves into small groups using the hunting-gatherer strategy to maximise the chances of survival, but it also allows rapid growth of the population as well as an increase in the average life expectancy. The human population before the hunter-gatherer revolution was estimated between 10,000 and 30,000. By the end of the Palaeolithic period, it reached between five and six million.
This first revolution teaches us an important lesson: it is more advantageous to collaborate with others to increase the chances of survival. It also teaches us that accepting hierarchy is a crucial step in the process. One can say some freedom was lost in the process, but this was clearly a voluntary decision, which makes all the difference.

The second revolution – agriculture
The population of humans continued to rise steadily until 12,000 years ago. At this stage, another revolution started: the Neolithic or agricultural revolution. Some tribes learned how to cultivate the land and began to grow crops. Agriculture was revolutionary because it increased their capacity of obtaining food, and consequently energy, enormously. This abundance enabled individuals to store food for times of scarcity and allowed them to stay indefinitely in a fertile region, without having to migrate every few years, which proved to be a considerable advantage for them.
Once again, if this were an observational study, the control group would have experienced a severe complication, death. At the same time, the intervention group not only survived the experiment but also increased its population size tremendously. 
The agriculture added one more element of complexity to the social organisation of tribes. The fact that there was no longer the need to migrate enabled them to create the concept of private property. The individuals who cultivated the land became their legitimate owners. In other words, by mixing their labour and sweat with the land was the natural way to claim ownership of a piece of land. But what would happen when the owner of the land died? The need to determine the legitimate owner of the earth after the passing of the previous owner led to the establishment of estate rules. 
But to do that, first, it was necessary to create a system to identify the fathers. At that point, all offspring were raised collectively by all adults in the community and determining paternity was not relevant. This model made it impossible to determine the father of most children, and the sense of collective responsibility was enough to convince all members to share the burden of raising the children equally. The solution was to create heterosexual monogamous relationships. Marriages naturally appeared to tackle social issues. Some populations even enforced the need to avoid sexual relationships during a woman’s period, while encouraging women to limit the number of sexual partners to one during a giving cycle. This behaviour enabled society to have more certainty about paternity. And this was crucial to implement estate rules.
There was no formal written law approved by any congress, but most people at the time understood the logic behind the rule and accepted it. Gradually, people observed that if they worked hard, not only they were able to obtain enough resources for their own, but they also managed to claim ownership on an extended piece of land. The asset would be turned into a larger estate, ultimately benefitting their offspring, who had a head start in life, thanks to the work ethic of their parents. This head start in life improved chances their offsprings’ chances of success as well as to passing on their genes. It is believed that recognising the advantages of working hard contributed to the origin of the protestant work ethic.
By this stage, all other hominid species failed to compete with the Homo sapiens, whose competitive advantage was far too great in comparison with hominids displaying different behaviours. Natural resources were scarce; therefore, they were extinct. It can be said the strategy adopted by these other hominid species was inefficient, and the price they paid was extinction.
The agricultural revolution was responsible for a substantial increase in our population. It is estimated that it reached 150 million by the year 1000 BC.

The third revolution – the great civilisations
The societal structure became more complex with the advent of the great civilisations, around 4,000 years ago. The surplus of food produced by the agricultural revolution enabled the specialisation of the labour force. This abundance led to the urbanisation process. Populations as large as five hundred thousand were observed in some states, as the Greek Empire. The Roman Empire went beyond, reaching a population of fifty million. 
The urbanisation process promoted agglomerations, which increased the risk of disease outbreaks. But it also enabled the flourishment of specialised labour, so it was a trade-off, like every other revolution.
The great civilisations enabled more cooperation between individuals who were at close proximity. This environment produced gains such as free trade, creating wealth. Conversely, some conflicts started to occur. Due to the large population cohabiting the same space, disputes had to be settled. Disagreements between individuals led to the creation of the Roman law, or Civil law. It influenced the more modern British common law. Ancient Greeks also promoted their own sets of rules. They created the concept of the rule of law, in which all individuals are considered equal and are subject to the same set of rules. Other civilisations that had a similar set of laws were the Mesopotamian and Indian Civilisations. It is interesting to note that the Chinese Empire adopted a slightly different model, called legalism, also known as the rule by law, in which aristocrats and emperor were above the law. 
Another feature of specialisation was the cultural contribution in fields like medicine, math, and philosophy. Greek philosophers like Plato are credited with values many people share today.
From the perspective of a hypothetical observational study, individuals who associated in large numbers creating great civilisations enabled a more prosperous environment, more advanced technology and a cultural legacy. The strategy gave them an advantage when compared to tribes who remained in small villages. 
The impact on population size created by the advent of great civilisations was enormous. By 1 AD the estimated population was 170 million. 

The fourth revolution – Renaissance, Scientific Revolution, and Enlightenment
The period between the 14th and the 16th centuries marked the transition between the dark ages and modernity in Europe. Social changes were the result of advancements in arts and science. The movement used Humanism as a learning method. It combined reasoning with empirical evidence to critique ancient texts. It led to dramatic structural changes in society, including the church. 
In the middle ages, most individuals had very little freedom, while aristocrats and the clergy held all the power. This period marked a shift in power from the oligarchs to the people, who increased their levels of freedom.
The scientific revolution occurred between the 16th and 17th centuries. It enabled the creation of the scientific method, advancements in astronomy, biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. The progress made in these fields enabled better health outcomes and consequently increased life expectancy.
The period between the 17th and 18th centuries in Europe saw the age of Enlightenment. Philosophers like Rene Descartes, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, John Locke, Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Voltaire made numerous contributions to philosophy and political science. The relationship between reason, God, nature, and humanity was the main focus of these philosophers. 
All these contributions had direct and indirect effects on population size. The development of new technologies improved the quality of life of many people. The world population was estimated at 450,000,000 in the fourteenth century. By the end of the eighteenth century, it reached the one billion mark.

The fifth revolution – industrial 
From 1760 until 1830, the industrial revolution took place in the United States and Europe. It marked the transition between hand production methods to the use of machines for mass production. It became a reality thanks to the advent of the assembly line, which broke down the manufacturing process in stages, increasing the division of labour and specialisation.
The most important legacy of this revolution was the economic change it produced. For the first time in history, it became clear that economic activity was not a zero-sum game. In game theory, a game in which all players compete for a finite number of resources, the sum of all gains and losses is zero. It assumes perfect information of all participants and perfect competition between participants. In an economic transaction, in which two parties voluntarily agree to trade goods or services, each party ranks desired goods or services (or money, in the case of the seller) according to their perception of value. And the desired goods or services rank higher then what they currently own. In other words, it has superior value for them. So, the outcome is positive because, after the transaction, each party considers itself wealthier. After all, they now own a more valuable good, service (or more money, in the case of the seller). 
Realising society is no longer playing a zero-sum game enabled people to promote strategies to accumulate wealth. Delayed gratification is one of them. When individuals work hard and live frugally, they increase the surplus, which constitutes capital that can be reinvested in a business generating compound interest, thus, much higher returns.
The increase in the number of economic transactions produced massive amounts of wealth and contributed to an abrupt spike in population size. By the end of the second industrial revolution, in 1900, the world population was 1.66 billion.

Other revolutions
More recently, more revolutions contributed to the growth of the world population. The advent of personal computers in 1974, the Internet in 1983, and the smartphone in 1992 are all examples of revolutionary technology. All these advancements led to the current world population of 7,825,010,684 people as this book is being written.

Key takeaway
We should be thankful for all people who came before us. They implemented strategies that later became the systems responsible for a tremendous competitive advantage we have today. They translate into higher life expectancy and fertility rates, thus, a steady and impressive population size. Each revolution came with benefits and drawbacks. In all cases, advantages surpassed the disadvantages. It is imperative to recognise this feature of all strategies if we want to make recommendations to improve our chances of survival as a species and therefore create a better world.
Chapter 6. Principles
All strategies were a result of reason, a unique feature displayed by humans that no other animal on the planet currently has. The positive outcome was accomplished by free and independent human beings.  Taking into consideration all the progress free humans have made, it is possible to say that the variable freedom may explain most of our success. If this book had a hypothesis, it would be:


The history of humankind and how every revolution promoted individual freedom were the rationale behind the hypothesis. I invite the reader to analyse events that took place in 2020 to check if the thesis still holds true and finally, based on the model, I make predictions on the future of our species.

The Non-aggression principle
It is also called the non-aggression axiom, meaning it is regarded as being established, or self-evident truth, even in multiple fields of knowledge. As an axiom, there is no evidence it is true, as it is a mere convention. But even exact sciences like math or physics need axioms to develop. Math is a product of humans. It is a tool created to explain the natural world. It is discovered based on the observation of natural phenomena, not invented. Thus, if one is talking about another realm, an unnatural one, the axiom of non-aggression may not be valid. But all my arguments are based on the natural world.
It is also called the non-coercion principle, the zero-aggression principle, or the non-initiation of force. It is a concept developed by authors who inspired the libertarian movement. It utilises moral values to protect individuals and private property. It does not condemn forceful defence or auto-defence.
Even though this axiom was first heard of in the 17th century, it can be further expanded into virtues, some of which were described more than 5,000 years ago.

Cardinal Virtues
The ancient Greek philosopher Plato promoted the idea that humans should follow four principles to be virtuous. He called them cardinal virtues. They were fortitude, justice, prudence, and temperance. Fortitude is also called courage, is the ability to confront fear and promote general well-being. Justice is also called fairness; it means to be righteous. Prudence is the ability to adopt a proper strategy at an appropriate time. And temperance is also known as a restraint; it means to be discrete, to show moderation.
These virtues have been accepted as forces behind human interaction with others; in other words, the moral compass guiding the communal living. Ancient priests from the Catholic Church have elected two sets of seven heavenly virtues, which are very similar to each other. One is a combination of the four cardinal virtues: Fortitude, justice, temperance, and prudence, in conjunction with the three theological virtues: Faith, charity (or love) and hope. The other is the antithesis of the seven deadly sins: Diligence (or fortitude), kindness, temperance, patience (or prudence), Chastity, charity, and humility. They oppose to sloth, envy, gluttony, wrath, lust, greed, and pride. These virtues have been crucial for humans to get along in the past. Abandoning them will likely result in regression and unnecessary suffering, not to mention reduced population growth and fertility rates.

Transcendentals
Another contribution of Greek philosophers like Plato, Parmenides, Aristotle, and Socrates was the concept of Transcendentals, or the three properties of being: truth, beauty and goodness. They correspond to the three fields of interest of humans: science (truth), arts (beauty), and religion (goodness). These fields of interest should be taught and encouraged in a society which would like to reduce unnecessary suffering and increase population size. 

Individual freedom
How do we promote individual freedom? Free will has been a topic of debate amongst the scientific community. Some authors claimed there was no such thing as free will because experimental studies showed we became conscious of our choices after they were already made. It may be valid to some extent. But real-life experiences have shown us that people may change their behaviour and reach different outcomes. 
One example is a person who wants to lose excessive weight. Most people fail when attempting this task, but a small minority succeeds. How can we explain the successful cases? If there is no free will, the outcome would be the same for everyone, and nobody would lose excessive weight. It may take time to promote change, it does not happen overnight, but it sure can happen. Humans are creatures of habit. It takes time to develop a habit. Some authors say up to ninety days to consolidate a new type of behaviour in our routine. If the subject is in the same environment, it requires much more discipline. If the environment does not change, the mind must do it. It depends on the general sets of beliefs one has. They are called principles. 
If every time we face a problem, we need to utilise reason to make a decision, it would be a far time-consuming process. That’s why we use shortcuts, the principles. We must complete thousands of decisions every day. Sometimes we don’t realise we have decided because we simply act automatically. We have habits that are ingrained in our minds, and we do not think, we just act. 

Fundamental rights
 One way to promote individual rights is to acknowledge fundamental rights or human rights. They are basic principles that protect individuals from others when living in a community. Even though the number of rights varies between organisations, ten are almost always present: 
Right to liberty
Right to freedom of thought
Right of free movement
Right to freedom of religion
Right to privacy
Right to due process of law
Right to freedom of expression
Right to self-determination
Right to peaceful assembly
Right to freedom of association

These rights have helped people fight injustices all around the world throughout history. Slavery dates to the Neolithic period, around 11,000 years ago. Today, it is estimated that over 40 million people are slaves, with 26% being children. Half of them is subject to forced labour, despite the practise being illegal. 
Freedom of thought and expression rights have been violated throughout the middle ages. Still today, people have been reporting cases where their freedom is taken away. Humans promoted liberty during the periods of renaissance, the scientific revolution, and the era of enlightenment. Still, communist ideas had to be banned in some countries in Eastern Europe, and more recently, big tech companies have censored people with different views on social media.
The right of free movement has been violated for more than 6,000 years, since the establishment of the great civilisations.  The refugee crisis in Europe is a recent example of some level of infringement of freedom of movement. 
The right to freedom of religion has also been violated for thousands of years. The Middle East has witnessed many conflicts motivated by religion. Many countries in the west were victims of terrorist attacks perpetrated by radicals motivated by their religious beliefs. In the East, concentration camps currently imprison more than 1,000,000 people whose religion is not tolerated by the local government. 
The right to privacy has been violated for centuries, but it became more frequent with the advent of electronic devices. The deep web sells personal information, photos and videos containing nudity and sex, even with minor victims. 
The right to due process of law has been infringed since the advent of Roman law, more than 5,000 years ago. People should have the right to face a fair trial to promote justice.
The right to self-determination has been consistently violated since its creation in 1860. Regions like Hong Kong, Eastern Ukraine, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Quebec, and Scotland have been fighting for decades to have their independence rights recognised. There are also many other regions fighting for their right of self-determination to this day.
The rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association have been violated in the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, and homosexuality is still illegal in Singapore. 
The civil act movement in the US, in 1964, is another example of a reversal of infringements of several human rights. People who defended the campaign accused dissidents of being “on the wrong side of history”. 
All principles seem to promote fair and justifiable actions, but sometimes we run into ethical dilemmas. It is essential to differentiate morality and ethics. Morality is the individual sets of values guiding their actions. Ethics is the standards of “good and bad” or “right and wrong” defined by a particular community in a given time. It can be considered moral to rescue a prisoner from a concentration camp run by a dictatorship, even if the majority of people backs him during that particular moment in history. This situation exemplifies a situation in which for one specific individual, morality deviates from the widely accepted ethics accepted by that population in that point in time. 
Another example is slavery. Some people’s moralities have allowed them to accept slavery in many communities throughout history. In contrast, some individuals already knew it was immoral, despite the fact it was not considered unethical by their society at the time. It is hard to point conflicts between morality and ethics in the present moment; it usually becomes evident when we change our perspective. Perhaps, in the future, humans will look back and consider it immoral to burn fossil fuels or consume animal protein. But to this day, we face pressing issues that partially justify these actions to minimise unnecessary suffering.

Chapter 7. Debating controversial issues
I believe dialect is an essential tool to improve our critical thinking. The human being is flawed at seeing their own mistakes, but it very good at pointing out other people’s mistakes. This is the rationale behind peer-reviews in scientific publications, as well as the justification for having purposeful, healthy debates. The best way to improve one’s dialectical skills is to practice with more experienced people. I am no expert, but my ability to use the dialectical method has improved thanks to the contribution of friends, family, and some of my favourite authors. 
You don’t have to start a debate over a controversial topic from scratch. Information is widely available, and if the subject is controversial enough, other intelligent people have come up with good arguments and have acknowledged counterarguments, so it is not necessary to reinvent the wheel every time we will discuss something. 
Sometimes it is hard, it involves concepts we are not familiar with, but it is always an excellent opportunity to learn. Knowledge is never useless. It may help you understand another concept later in life. I will try to compare the most frequent arguments used on both sides (I called them conservatives vs progressivists as the polarisation we often see today is in these two currents of thought). 

Debate during the cold war
From roughly the end of the Second World War in 1944 to the destruction of the Berlin wall in 1989, people have discussed public policies and their consequences. In this first part, I will present more moderate views on the topics, from left-wing liberals (or social democrats) and classic liberals (or conservatives). These two groups tend to agree a better world is a place where suffering is minimised, population growth is valued, and human rights are fundamental. More authoritarian worldviews (e.g. fascists and communists or globalists) will be addressed closer the end of the chapter. 

Warning


Economic inequality
Inequality is a topic of much debate. There are great arguments on both sides. Is it more urgent to address economic inequality or poverty? All opinions will change depending on the answer. 

Progressivists tend to believe economic inequality is a result of capitalism, or more specifically, the laissez-faire. By raising taxes, creating additional taxes, and promoting access to social benefits, they believe they are tackling economic inequality. They believe only complete equality is desirable, and they believe many people are so far behind they will not be able to make progress on their own.
Conservatives, on the other hand, acknowledge economic inequality is a pressing issue, but capitalism or laissez-faire is part of the solution, not the problem. They recognise inequality is a problem, but poverty is an even more pressing issue. And to lift people out of poverty, society should reduce regulation, not expand it. They believe some level of inequality is natural and even healthy. It stimulates people to work hard and prosper. Furthermore, they think taxes create incentives for tax evasion and avoidance. The Laffer curve, created by economist Arthur Laffer illustrates the phenomenon.
Both ideologies have good points, but the assumption that a significant part of society is paralysed by victimhood only makes things worse. If the elites understand the victimhood mentality does not contribute to individual growth, why do they continue to promote it? 

Drugs
This issue has been debated for decades, but we still see divided opinions. It is essential to define the ultimate goal of public policy. Is it to reduce the harm caused by drug use? Or is it to try to minimise the access to the youth?

Some conservatives use the logic if it is immoral, it should be illegal. Progressivists, on the other hand, believe individual freedom should be respected, even at the cost of some individuals becoming addicted and developing health complications. 
Both sides have good points on the subject. But the assumption imposing people a law that prohibits the consumption of some drugs will solve the issue is too simplistic. Some authors believe there will always be a demand for some drugs, therefore making them illegal only creates a black market which creates additional violence and perhaps a net result of positive suffering. If conservatives understand that implementing every system creates a consequence, why do they close their eyes to the war on drugs?

Critical race theory / Affirmative action
Critical race theory has been taught in many Universities and has many practical implications. One of them is Affirmative action. The idea of providing opportunities for individuals to achieve a desirable outcome has divided opinions across academics, the media, politicians, and the general public. Higher education has been considered essential to prepare individuals for the workforce. 

Economic inequality is a reason for concern, and this especially true considering ethnic minorities. In general, conservatives argue affirmative action will actually harm individuals who receive the benefit, for several reasons. At the same time, it harms individuals who were denied admission to a given University. Notably, the system harms other minority: Asians, who on average obtain the highest marks on admission tests. 

LGBTQ rights
Homosexuality has been encouraged, condemned, considered a mental disorder, and criminalised. It has never been ignored, though. Why have communities changed the way they see this type of behaviour? Some progressivists will argue people are born this way, while most conservatives will favour the choice theory. The truth t may lie somewhere in between.


There is more than one question involved, but there are many factors involved. Progressivists tend to believe LGBTQ are born this way. Some scientists disagree, for example, Dr Alfred Kinsey created in which sexual behaviour was classified according to a scale with a seven-gradient scale. Scholars also differentiate the incidence vs the prevalence of homosexuality, as most individuals report either none or just a few experiences of same-sex intercourse, meaning their behaviour changes over time. It is fair to conclude that some scientists believe there is a nurture component and homosexuality is not 100% genetic.
A Gallup poll found out Americans tend to overestimate the number of LGBTQ living in the country. In 2019, the average response was 23.6% of the population was either gay or lesbian. In 2017, a poll from the same institute found only 4.5% of Americans identified as gay or lesbian. It means people’s perception of homosexuality is five times higher than the real incidence. Therefore, society must discuss the subject based on facts.
Violence against the LGBTQ community is a real issue, and it must be acknowledged and adequately addressed. Homosexuality has played a vital role in improving the success of our species. There are several theories to explain this advantage: Homosexuals employed energy and gathered resources which improved their nephew’s chances of survival. LGBTQ people eventually had sex with women and passed on their genes directly, in exceptional situations like war. Lastly, the genes associated with homosexuality may create other advantageous traits.
LGBTQ people are humans; therefore, they deserve to be treated equally. Some people may consider the heterosexual union undesirable, but they should accept other people’s choices. If the non-aggression principle is not violated, we must avoid prejudice, be virtuous, display temperance, and let people live their lives. If the same-sex civil union is considered ethical in a given community, it should be respected. Furthermore, if the marriage has given our species a competitive advantage, this should be encouraged, not discouraged.

Transsexuality
The incidence of transsexuality is also exceptionally low. It was estimated at 9.2 cases per 100,000 people or 0.009%. It has become a topic of much debate because some people believe it is more prevalent than it really is. Medical doctors and psychologists may help to identify and provide assistance in such cases. Transsexuality is frequently associated with mental disorders; therefore, it is a health matter, more than an issue related to a social norm. If the ultimate goal is to promote health, improve population size, life expectancy and chances of reproduction, it is crucial to respect transsexual individuals’ rights. Reassignment surgery is often done in individuals older than 18 years old. Children often are not mature enough to make such an important decision, which is irreversible. Society must discuss the minimum age for the surgery to be performed, if indicated, and desired by the individual with the trait. 

Gender Identity
This topic is also very controversial. The scientific community has not reached a consensus, but many scholars understand that there are several biological differences between men and women. And with rare exceptions, it is possible to determine the sex with a simple clinical exam, or in some cases, with the karyotype. It is a subject worth taking some time to get as much information as necessary. The idea of gender as a social construct must be seen with caution. To illustrate the desire of some researchers to prove their theory, I bring the case of David Raimer, a Canadian boy who was treated by Dr John Money, a psychologist specialising in sex changes at the time. The boy underwent a circumcision, but he had complications, and a significant part of his penis was removed. In 1967, at the age of 17 months, he underwent castration and became Brenda. By the age of 13, she developed depression and suicidal thoughts. She did not accept her body. Somehow, she felt something was not right. And the psychologist had to disclose she was born a boy. Shortly after that, at age 14, she decided to become David again. He went through several surgeries to have this gender reassigned. In 2002, he told his wife he wanted to get divorced. In 2004, at age 38, he committed suicide. This story illustrated how a cautious approach should be adopted when interfering with natural gender identities. 

Immigration
Conservatives tend to propose strict criteria to allow foreign individuals to enjoy resident benefits in wealthy countries. Progressivists, on the other hand, tend to see the issue as a humanitarian matter and favour fewer restrictions on immigration.


Conservatives tend to focus on the burden that unskilled immigrants may pose. They fear a spike in criminality and a sharp increase in social benefits requests. Progressivists, on the other hand, believe refugees should always be welcome, and in many cases, people who are fleeing poverty, and not only war, achieve a status similar to refugees. They believe that immigrants also consume. Therefore, they contribute to maintaining the economy running. 
If immigrants do not violate the principle of non-aggression, theoretically they should be allowed in a region. The cultural aspects, including their moral values, is something crucial that should be taken into consideration. To conclude, each community should decide the minimum requirements to allow immigrants to join their community.

Free healthcare for all
Health is something most of us consider so precious we tend to believe it should be a right. A utopian world where high-quality healthcare was provided for all at no cost would be a dream. Conservatives and left-wing liberals have very different points of view on the subject.

Promoting high levels of health standards should be a priority in most civilised societies. But how to achieve this goal? Some conservatives have pointed out the effect of the tragedy of the commons when single-payer healthcare is implemented. When all members of society have “free” access to healthcare, some of them stop promoting health by choosing to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Appropriate diet, exercises, and living a purposeful, fulfilling life play a vital role in the overall health status of individuals. By taking away the responsibility of the individual, some of them may make poor choices, which increase the burden on the healthcare system, making it impossible to provide high-quality healthcare for all.
Furthermore, rights should not be granted for finite resources, such as healthcare. The wages of medical staff is often lower in countries with single-payer healthcare, which creates an exodus of qualified professionals. The system needs to attract professionals with poor skills who are willing to accept a lower salary to replace them. It contributes to creating a lower standard of care.

Abortion
Abortion is a sensitive topic for many people. If we aim to increase population size and increase fertility rates, as well as life expectancy, discouraging abortion becomes a no-brainer. What is the best approach to reach this outcome? 

Abortion is a controversial subject because, for many people, it involves two human beings. Conservatives tend to be pro-life, with some of them in favour of criminalising the practice. They believe life begins at conception. Progressivists, of the other hand, think the woman has the right over her body, and there is no definitive evidence the embryo or foetus is a living being. This confusion becomes even more significant because the individual is recognised by the state and granted human rights only after birth. Furthermore, some progressivists have pointed out that when abortion is criminalised, illegal abortions tend to occur, and often the mother experiences complications, which promotes additional suffering.
The argument for proving assistance to pregnant women, in an attempt to dissuade counsel and provide guidance may reduce the incidence of abortions. Efforts in educating children, providing information, including contraceptive methods, could also contribute to reducing the number of abortions. Parents, schoolteachers, psychologists and doctors should combine efforts to achieve the best outcome.

Gun control
Should we aim at reducing the number of circulating guns? Does selling guns after proper checks contribute to a reduction in violence? These questions divide specialists. If we desire to increase population size, life expectancy, and fertility rates, we should focus on reducing criminality rates.

Both currents of thoughts have good points. There is conflicting evidence in various countries available, supporting both views. This topic is difficult to be studied because of the numerous factors affecting criminality indexes.
The non-aggression principle allows self-defence. Eliminating guns altogether is a utopia. Today it is already possible to print a rudimentary but fully functional gun with a 3D printer. And even if it was possible, removing all guns creates a world where the strongest always prevail, which is barbaric. Therefore, in doubt, perhaps allowing citizens to acquire guns after appropriate checks legally may contribute to population growth. 

Patents and copyrights
Creating incentives for inventors has been a considerable challenge in the past two hundred years. The excess bureaucracy and regulation created by the state discouraged innovation. It still perpetuates many injustices to this day. Pharmaceutical companies pocked large profits due to these rules. It is also valid for software and hardware corporations, like Microsoft. Multiple corporations have tried to challenge the system with different outcomes. The first music streaming platform, Napster, was defeated by record companies. Spotify, on the contrary, has won the battle and has increased in value considerably. Conservatives tend to favour maintaining the rules, though some of them accept that innovation is dynamic, and the length of protection should be revised. Progressivists, conversely, tend to support the extinction of the rule altogether. 

Paedophilia
Paedophilia is one of the most sensitive subjects discussed by people interested in creating public policies. Both sides accuse individuals of supporting paedophilia because they know how heinous this crime is. Even criminals do not forgive this kind of offence in penitentiaries.
It is not possible to cite the best arguments on both sides because there is general agreement that the practice is immoral, and it should be banned. Two groups of left-wing intellectuals are exceptions. The first has defended that paedophilia should be seen as any other sexual orientation. They constitute a tiny minority. In contrast, the second think the best way to deal with it is to differentiate the act and the consumption of pornographic material. It becomes especially true when it involves computer-generated graphics or animes.
Some authors argue that each individual’s body is their private property. Therefore, it should not be violated to conform to the non-aggression principle.

Identity politics
Identity politics is a political approach in which people are divided into classes according to their individual characteristics. All topics discussed above can be summarised into this approach. The concept of identity politics was not created by a single author but received contributions from different authors. The term may have been used for the first time in April 1977 in a statement from a Black feminist group leader called Combahee River Collective. This group not only divided people according to their sex but also according to their skin colour. They failed to see that men and women are different, and we should aim to reduce income inequality, not eradicate it. Fighting the patriarchy fails to acknowledge the benefits of marriage. Fighting racial income inequalities should be pursued through the promotion of equality of opportunities. A world with equality of outcomes would be a nightmare.
Furthermore, when two identity politics clash with each other, they create something called intersectionality, in which two or more identities are present in the same individual. How to solve a dispute when multiple individuals present multiple identities? Creating a hierarchy of identities would also be disastrous. 
Another contributor was Italian Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who claimed the bourgeoisie (upper class) oppressed the proletariat (lower class). He failed to see the benefits of voluntarily exchanging labour for money.
The estate duty, also known as inheritance tax, may have been created at the end of the 19th century in the UK, to pay for government deficit. What most people at the time failed to realise was the contribution of starting a family had on most individuals, and the estate tax punished those who worked hard to provide higher chances of survival for their children.
In 1971, the French feminist Simone de Beauvoir, one of the proponents of gender identity, joined the manifesto of the 343, a petition signed by 343 women who said they have had an abortion. To criminalise the practice, as it was the case at the place and time, can be extreme. But by promoting the practice, unintended consequences on other people may arise, like downplaying the disastrous experience of an abortion.
The gun control issue divides people between law-abiding citizens and criminals. Restrictions to immigrations divide people between those whose citizenship is approved by the state, and those who not. And it has even a complicating factor, it allows tourism but not permanently residing in most countries.

Ethics and the cost being unethical
Some people realise the conflict between taxing the wealthy and proving essential services like healthcare to vulnerable situations. What is the moral thing to do? Some people believe taxing the wealthy, especially when they have already paid their income taxes and every other exiting tax, just because they are wealthy, is unethical and morally wrong. Others believe the need of the vulnerable is more pressing, therefore taxing the wealthy is justifiable. Both opinions provide good arguments, but one must investigate the unintended consequences of being unethical.
Taxing the wealthy, supporting affirmative action, downplaying the war on drugs, and downplaying the complications of illegal abortion are all examples of unethical public policies that give a sense of justice for the proponents while placing the burden of the consequences on innocent people. While people benefit from increased tax revenue, the wealthy must bear the aggression alone. While the proponents of affirmative action believe they are helping some minorities, the people who are left out (mostly Asians) must carry the burden alone. While maintaining drug trafficking illegal, some people may think they are reducing harm, but victims of gang violence and some recreational conscious drug users pay the price. And lastly, while some people believe that by creating barriers for abortion, they are saving lives, the women who undergo clandestine abortions and experience complications pay the price alone.

The social contract
The social contract is a theory or model creating during the Age of Enlightenment in the middle of the 17th century. It attempts to explain the legitimacy of the state over the individual. Many influential philosophers wrote on the subject. It was a clever solution to mitigate the effects of other suboptimal systems in place at the time. It was a quick fix to a complex problem. Like other interventions, it created terrible unintended consequences. 
The simple fact that the supposed contract does not formally exist is a major problem. The fact that its clauses are subjective and unknown is another issue. The fact that no individual has signed the contract makes is invalid, from any sensible point of view. And lastly, such contract has no date or exit clause.

Political orientation diagram and political regimes
No diagram places all political orientations without criticism. My attempt is an oversimplified version of previous works from other authors, and it summarizes the ideas I will describe.

Fig 4. Diagram of political orientation regimens. Social democracy is a similar movement to left-wing liberalism in the US, and Classic liberalism is an ideology that is similar to conservativism in the US.

Authoritarian political regimes
Left-wing liberals (social democrats) and Classic liberals (conservatives) agree that freedom is essential; they aim at creating an equal society, and both value life. Their fundamental disagreement is on how to get there. Only the strategies to reach the same outcome differ between each group.
The other two political regimes are fundamentally different. They are authoritarian, sometimes totalitarian, and will employ any means to accomplish their goals, an outcome with two distinct social classes, the rulers, or oligarchy, and the people, who have minimal freedom.

Communism, Globalists worldview
Karl Marx has influenced many thinkers since the 19th century. Communism was attempted in several locations at different points in time, and it has been a failure whenever the model was attempted. In the USSR, during the ruling of Stalin, it is estimated that up to 20,000,000 people died as a result of public policies. In China, during the mandate of Mao Zedong, in a period called the great leap forward, it is estimated that up to 40,000,000 people died as a result of public policies. Those two death tolls were not war casualties. They happened in a historical period of peace. Today, countries like North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and China still have many characteristics of socialism and communism. And other countries are heading in the same direction.

Fascism and Nazism
Fascism was a far-right movement marked by ultra-nationalism. Some forms of the regime were seen in Europe, especially Italy, from 1914 to 1945. The state concentrated all powers. Benito Mussolini proclaimed: “Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state”. The rulers opposed socialism and communism, and they aimed to strengthen the nation and the state by encouraging social traditions like marriage, hard work, and economic principles like capitalism (with heavy regulations from the government, therefore, not laissez-faire). People who did not work towards common goals were severely punished.
Nazism, or Nacional socialism, is considered a form of fascism. It took place in Germany from 1933 to 1945. It is estimated that the regimen killed 6 million Jews and 11 million other victims during the Holocaust era. Even though some deaths occurred during the Second World War, the majority died in circumstances unrelated to the war.

Influences on people’s ideology today
Some highly educated receive formal education for many years and fail to realise obvious aspects of history. After authoritative regimens have caused much suffering during the first half of the 20th century, the world witnessed a shift towards liberalism. Little information was available on the efficacy of implementing each system, but most people agreed that freedom would lead humanity towards progress, reducing suffering and promoting life. This lack of information divided people into social-democrats and conservatives. They disagreed on regards to the path, but both currents of though agreed on the desirable outcome. 
Even though authoritative regimens have caused significant harm to individuals in many instances during history, as the years passed by, many people forgot the horrors of authoritarianism. Sometimes people are more focused on the path to reach their desired outcome rather than to agree on the desirable result. It led to the revival of neofascist and modern globalist or progressivist groups, who were sure about their theories, and they would employ violent means, if necessary, to achieve their goals, whatever they may be.
Humanity is living a unique moment in which we need to look back, examine the history of humankind, acknowledge our victories, learn from our mistakes, and design a proper strategy for the future. The first step is to agree on the desirable outcome, preferably a measurable goal. And then we should identify the compromises necessary to achieve our goal. Is it worth sacrificing freedom to achieve safety and equality?

Chapter 8. Impacts on my life
Acknowledging the systems responsible for human progress in the past 200,000 years and many concepts derived from these strategies can help to improve many aspects of our lives. I will share some concrete changes I observed in my physical, mental, and social health as a result of things I learned during all my life, but especially during my quest for knowledge in the past five years. Some people argued I had been a radical, with extreme views, and lastly, I was accused of Manicheism. But to me, the benefits more than justified the risk of being seen as an extravagant person.

Body composition
Investments are an essential part of my life, and the delayed gratification strategy, represented by the buy-and-hold method used to buy stocks, is something that fascinates me. The protestant ethics of hard work and frugal living was quickly incorporated in my life. I started to flirt with a minimalist lifestyle, which I also consider positive from an environmental perspective. When I translated the delayed gratification concept to my diet, I became interested in intermittent fasting, which is an eating regimen in which you only eat in a restricted period, while fasting most of the day. I currently have only one meal a day, with an exception every two weeks or so. Losing weight is a challenging task because most of us eat very frequently. The higher the number of opportunities we have (to make a mistake), the more likely we will. 
This strategy led to adopt a low-carbohydrate diet, which I consider more suitable for promoting overall health. My father developed pre-diabetes; therefore, I should avoid eating too many high-carbohydrate foods to prevent insulin resistance. More recently, I incorporated the consumption of at least 5kg of snap-frozen vegetables into my weekly diet. Using apps to track macronutrients consumed each day was really helpful in the beginning. Furthermore, I have been running consistently for the past eight years. I have run two full marathons and countless half-marathons. I also practice resistance training. I find powerlifting an excellent way to measure my performance objectively. All these changes have helped me keep my BMI in the 23 range, which is normal. I also maintain my body fat percentage relatively low, at 13% last time I measured it.  

Mental health
Living as an expat can be a challenging situation. I decided to abandon the clinical practice, which was something I enjoyed. I am grateful for the academic opportunities given to me, and now I have a clear path towards a career in research and teaching. I consider myself fortunate for never having had a personal or family history of mental disorders. I am aware anxiety and depression are highly prevalent these days. 
I have recently taken a DNA test to find out more about my ancestors, and I was amazed to find I currently have fifteen different ethnic groups as my ancestors. As time passes, more and more people take these tests, so it becomes possible to use the information to break down large ethnic groups further. In the future, all of us will realise we have dozens of ethnic groups as our ancestors. An all of them probably have a common ancestor. Therefore, there is not such a thing as superior and inferior races. I have never been a racist, but this experience showed me racists are not very scientifically accurate. It is an example of how education can contribute to reducing suffering.
I have always wanted to start meditating regularly, but I lacked the patience to do it. This year I hurt my back while returning to the gym after an extended period of lockdown. I experienced intense pain, and this led me to re-evaluate my life, and I started doing two things: stretching (to prevent further back problems) and meditating. I believe the practice has helped me to focus and accept adversities in life more easily. 
I had some ups and downs during the year 2020, but I believe I will heal without any scar. If I hurt anyone emotionally, I am sorry, and I hope they can heal as well.  I feel I have fulfilled all levels of the Maslow hierarchy of needs this year, and I am confident things will continue to improve in the years to come. I have been an optimist all my life, and despite some questioning this year, I still consider myself an optimist.

Social health
I am really grateful to my family and friends for being on my side, being comprehensive, I feel I have a strong network of good friends in whom I can count. Becoming a parent was one of the most impactful changes in my life, it has been a wonderful experience, and it significantly helped me to promote personal growth. Being responsible for loved ones is a tremendous incentive to be a virtuous person, especially displaying fortitude. Having kids also improves one’s patience, temperance, and justice. I have never been a religious person. I have always had some form of spirituality, and I sympathised with the karma concept, but I have never attended any religious temple regularly. I have always agreed with Christian principles, Judaic traditions, and Buddhist teachings. This journey has reinforced my connection with these beliefs. I try not to focus on the contradictions between faiths. Instead, I try to look for common teachings and live my life accordingly. I admire people of faith, and maybe one day, I will start going to Church regularly. I find the uncertainty of the future a positive aspect of life. 

Objective measures
If you have learned anything by reading this book, I suggest you try to implement some of these concepts in your life. I find it essential to establish SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-oriented); otherwise, it is hard to make consistent progress. The victimhood mentality is destructive. It paralyses us and promotes regression rather than improvement. Loving yourself first is fundamental. Everyone should have principles, which ultimately help to become a better person. Only then, they are able to love someone else and try to reduce that person’s suffering. And lastly, they are able to participate in their immediate community. 

Chapter 9. A tailored reality
Recent years have been marked by heated debates in social media, mainstream media, not even friends and family can get along because of fundamental differences. In my case, these disagreements became especially more frequent in 2020. I attribute people’s intolerance to two main factors: in-writing communication and the algorithms of social media platforms.
Texting is a revolutionary way of communication that made life much more convenient. Making telephone calls was great, but it often got in the course of other priorities. The need for other peoples’ attention made phone calls a thing of the past, especially for the younger generations. Like every other revolution, this system came with benefits and drawbacks. The advantage was the convenience of texting when available, not disturbing others as much as ringing them; while the flaw was the loss of the tone of voice. When texting, you don’t get the whole picture, only words. People may be feeling sad, sarcastic, frustrated. Even when using emojis, gifs, and memes, it is not the same as actually listening to someone’s voice. From face-to-face conversation to phone calls, we had already lost facial expressions, so the tone of voice was a loss on top of it. Don’t get me wrong. I believe texting is a great communication tool. We just need to use it properly. Sometimes making a video call is better. And sometimes only having a cup of coffee will meet the people’s requirements. Texting sometimes is too simplistic and cause unnecessary misunderstandings.
The other factor, which I consider much more relevant to the issue, is the algorithms of social media platforms. It was something many of us were aware of but simply ignored. The movie The Social Dilemma depicted the issue more realistically. Not only the algorithms were shaping the way we see the world by choosing the contents of our feeds, but it was also creating a unique reality. Whenever we enjoy some type of content, the algorithm records the information and suggest not only more similar contents but even more extreme versions of the same content. It is particularly true for political subjects. The algorithm learned that people usually spend more time on the platform when they found something more interesting. And people naturally were seeking for content that reinforced their worldview. This phenomenon is real for people with all ideologies, but the audience leaning towards the left usually tend to be more passionate about issues, and they tend to report content they don’t agree with more frequently than right wing-oriented people.  This trend is seen across many platforms. It even led to the creation of a platform that respects the freedom of speech; it is called Parlor. Users with right-wing views have been widely adopting it after being censored in other social media. 
The cancel culture is another phenomenon that happens almost entirely thanks to left-wing users.  Authors who publish content that goes against these users are “cancelled”, meaning they have their jobs jeopardised by enraged users. In late June 2020, The Harper Magazine published a letter on Justice and open debate signed by 153 liberal intellectuals, criticising what they called “illiberalism”. Most of them were concerned about being a victim of the cancel culture following the episode experienced by the English writer J. K. Rowling after she had written on the transgender subject. A poll from the Pew Research Center found up to 90% of Republicans believed social media platforms (somewhat or very likely) censored political viewpoints, while only 59% of Democrats had the same opinion in 2020. 
The users with left-wing views are more engaged in reporting content to which they disagree. They are also less likely to believe that some users’ political viewpoints were being censored by social media platforms. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the engagement on left-wing leaning content is higher than neutral or right-wing leaning content. In 2016, a big social media platform was accused of influencing the 2016 presidential election. The company’s CEO was interrogated by the US Senate and blamed the algorithm for promoting particular political views. In 2020, with the rise of COVID-19, it is reasonable to assume the same phenomenon occurred, at least partially, towards left-wing content in recent years. It probably happened in other social media platforms. 
Not only the general public was influenced by social media, but also content creators, journalists, academics, celebrities, politicians, and other segments of society. In the case of journalists, it became particularly relevant, with some of them abandoning independent journalism altogether, in favour of merely giving their opinions on the news. Most of them did not disclose the articles were part of an editorial, though. Some editors deliberately started to choose whether or not the information would be made public based on how well they would fit in the narrative to support the paper’s political orientation. 
Some journalists were fired for reporting facts. Others were called racists and nazists, like former NY Times journalist Bari Weiss, who had joined the newspaper following the 2016 election to investigate why the paper had failed to anticipate the election of a Republican president. She quit the newspaper in the second week of July and wrote an open letter explaining her motives.
These two factors, texting and social media algorithms, and all their consequences, partially create a different reality for each person. What has been called “Fake News” sometimes is just a biased point of view of a fact. Sometimes it is mostly true, sometimes it is partially true, and sometimes it is a blatant lie. Depending on the willingness of the user to do their own research, the truth may never be known. 
This multitude of ways a fact is being reported, without a clear distinction between independent fact-reporting and editorials containing opinions, contributes to an erosion of credibility of some traditional communication groups. Since the beginning of his term, the president of the United States has been accusing a big TV network of spreading fake news. He even called the network “fake news”. Some viewers may disagree with these claims, but the network was condemned by justice of the state of Kentucky for reporting the high-school student Nick Sandmann was allegedly disrespecting a Native American in front of the Lincoln Memorial at the National Mall in Washington D.C.  The young man’s attorneys sought 275 million dollars in damages, and the parts settled on an undisclosed amount.

Epidemiologists divided
Another example of a recent divide was the publication of the Great Barrington Declaration, on the 4th of October, followed by the John Snow Memorandum, published in a major medical journal ten days after the first. The Great Barrington Declaration is a letter developed and signed by three lead epidemiologists and medical experts warning world leaders, researchers, and the general public about the negative health impacts of COVID-19 policies being enforced at the time. The John Snow Memorandum came in response, barely addressing any concern expressed by the authors of the first document. I invite the author to do some independent research on the arguments pro and con COVID-19 policies. At the time this book is being written, the Great Barrington Declaration had more than 46,000 signatures from medical practitioners and medical & public health scientists, and more than 633,000 signatures from the general public. Meanwhile, the John Snow Memorandum had less than 7,000 signatures from scientists, researchers & healthcare professionals. They have not disclosed the number of signatures from the general public. This 7-fold difference between each recommendation demonstrates how the expert opinion diverges from most politicians.
Each individual’s situation is unique, but some people are experiencing completely different realities from their peers. And this artificial abyss makes it impossible to debate in a purposeful manner. It is almost like people were living in different realities. Their perspectives were unique, sometimes they were a little misinformed, and this becomes a rough start for any talk that aims at unity and agreement. In my particular case, it was almost like we were all under some kind of spell, which made it impossible to reconcile with friends.
Another reason it was incredibly difficult for me to seek an agreement was that I adopted an inflexible posture. I have always been very rational and tried to be well informed. My lifestyle allowed me to have plenty of free time, which I used to watch the news and try to do my research to find the truth. My friends, on the other hand, were busy with other duties and had little disposition to search for counterarguments.

Chapter 10. A controversial election
 The US presidential election has been a topic of heated debate worldwide. People were already divided before the election, and it only became worse after the 3rd of November. It drew the attention of many people living in countries thousands of kilometres from the US. Some of them felt that their lives would be highly impacted by the elections’ results. 
This phenomenon was an unusual election for many reasons. The pandemic made many changes in the voting process. The polarisation process which divided American voters started in 2012, but it picked up in 2016, and it definitely became much worse in 2020. People have become more dependent on social media to obtain information.  Mainstream media tried to keep up with the rhythm of social media by promoting unverified information. 
I will not get into details of accusations exchanged by the two major parties. What I found impressive was how many people were able to make very accurate predictions on the outcomes. 
Bernie Sanders, from the Democratic Party, was one of the people who predicted there would be a “red mirage” on election night, meaning a Trump lead, which would be overturned by later results from Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and other states. They will not be able to count the votes, for unknown reasons to him, until several days after the election. He predicted Trump would claim victory on TV on the election night, but after counting the mail-in ballots in these states several days after the Election Day, Biden would have actually won these states. It is jaw-dropping to observe the depth of details in his predictions. Considering what the polls predicted at the time, it was even more impressive. Most pollsters were pointing to a comfortable victory for Biden in all three states (his lead was 9%, 6%, and 10% in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, respectively). All leads were above the margin of error of 4.4%. The video became viral, with many people believing Sanders was some kind of prophet.
 Election Day took place with almost no incidents. At night, most states showed results completely off when compared to the forecast made by pollsters, which indicated a comfortable victory for Biden. Even though Trump was leading in most swing states, pointing towards a defeat for the democratic candidate, Biden went on TV and said he was feeling optimistic, as the results were ‘on-track’ for his victory. Trump responded about one hour after saying he could already see victory coming. Many republicans were confident Trump would win, but some were still hesitant to make the call. Overnight, there was a surge in votes for Biden, who surpassed Trump in a few states, increasing his lead. It took another three days to count votes in some states. In contrast, others allowed more time for mail-in ballots to arrive and still be counted, like the state of Georgia, where Trump held a small margin, therefore, the result could be delayed until the 12th of November (9 days after Election Day).
On Saturday, the 7th of November, Biden was “called” in the remaining states necessary to get 270 electoral votes. Most mainstream media declared the candidate the 46th elected president, even though Trump’s committee still disputed the count judicially due to some irregularities in some states. According to the US constitution, it was not the media responsible for pointing out the winner; it was the congress. A premature victory claim could make electors confused and diminish the trust in the democratic process. 
That same day I decided: leaving all social media and stop reading the news in biased newspapers. I had already deleted all social media apps from my phone after watching the social dilemma movie in September.  I kept only a major video platform, which I thought I would be able to watch and critically filter the suggested contents. But this time it was for real, I wanted to be influenced as little as possible. Reuters seemed to me as one of the least biased sources of information, so I decided to obtain information exclusively from it. I tried to ignore the news sent to me by friends and family.
I let my close friends know about my decision, and I said I would only answer questions, but I would avoid bringing controversial topics to be debated. One day later, one of my close friends asked me something about the US election, I tried to avoid confrontation, but things escalated, and for the first time one of my friends left the chat. I tried to apologise, it took me two days and a one-hour call, but he finally decided to forgive me and re-join the group. It was a good lesson for me because I cared much about those four mates who have been loyal friends for the past 24 years.
The reason for my friend’s exit was a question I brought to the chat. I asked why I could not find any democrat or Democratic Party supporter in favour of investigating the irregularities pointed by the Trump committee. The narrative was the same everywhere - “There will be some evidence of irregularities, but it will not be enough to change the outcome of the election”. If Biden’s lead was about 270,000 votes in four or five states, and the total number of votes exceeded 160,000,000, it represents less than 0.17% of all votes. With such a small lead, and in an attempt to restore trust in the democratic system, it would be fair to assume that at least some moderate Democratic Party supporters would favour an investigation. But that was not the case. So apparently most people were ok with abandoning their principles to make sure their candidate was the winner. Or they were being misguided by false information or a combination of both.
On the 11th of November morning, I realised something. And it was a fantastic experience, something I will never forget. I had finally realised why my friends and I were unable to reach an agreement. Not even my parents or younger brother would understand my point of view. They are highly educated and very reasonable people, so I was perplexed by their unwillingness to either point out where our beliefs differed, and the reason for disagreement, or at least agree with me to some extent.
Everything became clear when two diagrams came to my mind. The first was an explanation of how our society is evolving and organising itself. All systems in place that promoted the population growth had advantages and disadvantages. They all meant to accept a trade-off. It was always an exchange between freedom and safety (or equality). First, humans gave away some freedom to improve safety and become even freer as the net result. But, at one point, the environment became very prosperous (to some extent). But it was not equally prosperous. Some inequality was seen as the result of such prosperity. It merely showed that every positive system brings advantages and disadvantages to humans who decide to collaborate with each other. After all, nothing in nature is universally equal. The Pareto principle shows us most distributions are unequal. 
To fix this inequality and create artificial equality, some individuals decided to propose opposing systems to mitigate the disadvantages of the strategies which made all the progress in the first place. And obviously, this had a negative effect on progress, because all solutions were systems that cancelled out the results of the methods that promoted progress to begin. At this point, the path towards progress was over, and society chose to follow a regressive path, where a significant amount of freedom continues to be exchanged by some safety, but the net result is negative. Therefore, it becomes less advantageous for all individuals involved. Most of these opposing systems were proposed by the state, which divided people into two groups: those affluent, who had to pay their share, and those vulnerable, who were entitled to their “fair” share, regardless of their contribution to society. They failed to understand individuals are different and therefore reach different outcomes in life. Like everything in nature, human outcomes vary. The Pareto principle illustrates it.
I realised this trade-off between freedom and safety (and equality) was not merely a two-dimension equation. There was also a third dimension: Reality. And out of the three, any society model could only pick a maximum of two. 
The following diagram reminded me of the diagram of investments risk (or investment pyramid). To me, it makes sense because the stock market is virtually free from regulation. It reflects a natural aspect of these kinds of trade-offs. The investment diagram has the following three dimensions: risk, returns, and liquidity. You can only pick a maximum of two out of three.

Fig 5. Investment risk vs return diagram (also known as investment pyramid). The intersection of the three circles in the middle, represented by the hatches is impossible to exist in the natural world.

The returns are the equivalent of freedom; liquidity is equivalent to reality; and (avoidance of) risk is comparable to safety. 

Fig 6. Diagram of societal models. The intersection of the three circles in the middle, represented by the hatches is impossible. The dark blue intersection between the realms of reality and freedom represents the anarcho-capitalist society, the dark red intersection between the circles of reality and safety represents the tyrannical society, and the dark brown intersection between the realms of freedom and safety represent the virtual reality society.

This thought led me to propose three models of societies in which humans could live in harmony. Each would prioritise two realms while giving up on the third. The first type of society would prioritise freedom and reality while abandoning safety. The second would prioritise safety and reality while giving up freedom. And the third would combine freedom and safety at the expense of reality.
The first type of society would resemble an anarcho-capitalist community, where individuals enjoy maximum freedom but are aware of the drawbacks of all systems promoting this freedom. Therefore, each individual is responsible for their own safety. Equality is promoted by each person’s sense of fortitude combined with other individuals’ sense of charity, resulting in voluntary acts of kindness. Justice would be enhanced by each individual, and if there is a dispute, it would be settled by a third party, which was neutral. This system has received much criticism because it has not been attempted in any region yet. It may solve many problems we have today, and some solutions are still unavailable because we have not been able to spend enough time on proposing solutions to them. Fundamental rights would be guaranteed to all residents, education would be a priority, people would be incentivised to acknowledge the four cardinal virtues, and there would be a high level of equality between members of society. People would also be encouraged to reduce their impact on the planet by recycling, reducing, and repurposing. 
The type model of society would be tyrannical. There would be two classes of residents. The ruler class would form an oligarchy, enjoying not only the reality but some freedom. In contrast, the vast majority of residents would work to provide goods and services, while the oligarchy’s role would be to certify the model is flawless. There would be no fundamental rights for the workers, no access to information or proper education, only one source of information (a TV network owned by the state), and a high level of surveillance on the workers. The punishments would be very harsh, and there would be very little freedom. Oligarchs would enjoy a life of luxury, but from time to time, some of them would be victims of plots and murdered by other oligarchs. There would be no concern about natural resources. 
Lastly, the third type of society would be based on virtual reality. There would also be two classes of residents, a minority with privileges including reality and some freedom, the business owners; and the vast majority who would be living fully sedated in dormitories, plugged into a virtual reality machine, which would emulate the virtual version of the world of their dreams. The rulers would be responsible for guaranteeing their wellbeing, with cyborg nurses inserting catheters into their noses and veins to feed them, as well as maintaining the hygiene and preventing and treating complications, if possible. These clients would voluntarily sign a contract with the rules of the service provided by the business owners.
Some individuals could also choose to live in the wild without interacting with other humans. They would pick reality and maximum freedom, at the expense of communal living. That would not violate the Non-aggression principle either.
There would be little interaction between residents of each territory. The exception would be when residents of the anarcho-capitalist society voluntarily decided to move to the virtual reality society. Another instance would be when a member of the anarcho-capitalist society committed a serious crime and was condemned to deportation to the tyrannical society, as a worker. Conversely, when an individual in the tyrannical society started to get into trouble because of libertarian beliefs, the rulers may decide to send them to the anarcho-capitalist community. This dynamic could be implemented as an exchange. It has happened in an analogous manner in the past, in periods of war, when prisoners were exchanged between rival armies. 
The second diagram was an explanation of how our species has evolved, making progress and increasing freedom. But this occurs in a circular manner, as shown below. At the lowest point of the circle, individuals reach a point of maximum freedom and safety. At this stage, they start trying to solve issues created by the systems that brought so much prosperity in the first place. This task is accomplished by implementing opposite mechanisms that ultimately revert the benefits and destroy all the progress made. It eventually leads the species back to the beginning, with the least amount of freedom, closing the circle. But, at this stage, there so much inequality, that this population creates two social classes. The first is the oligarchy, entitled to rights, with the duty to perpetuate the system, and the second one is the lower class, with little to no rights, who produces all the abundance necessary to fulfil the needs of their society. This social distinction is justified based on keeping the system in place, and whoever questions the differentiation between classes by bringing arguments for freedom and real equality is severely punished. 

Fig 7. Evolution diagram. At 1200 hours, the first human started its journey towards freedom. Considerable progress was made along the way. At 0600 hours, our society passed a turning point where it started going backwards, towards a less free community, and will ultimately end in extinction.

The creation of the concept depicted in the diagram was mind-blowing for me. I had finally understood the reason behind so much conflict between my friends and family and me. I consider myself a good person, genuinely interested in other people’s best interest. I often put others before me. I consider myself an altruistic person. And I also consider my friends and family, good people. They are highly-educated, loyal, trustworthy, real examples for the rest of society. This anxiety I was feeling was suddenly over. I had finally found the point of disagreement. I had realised the concept, and they simply hadn’t. I could not wait to show them what I had discovered. And even if they disagreed with me, I could still be in peace. I am a very rational person, but whenever I think about this subject, I get emotional. It is impossible to control.

Chapter 11. Future challenges
A society that values freedom does not come without challenges. The anarcho-capitalist ideology has received criticism, and many authors have tried to solve the most pressing issues with the system. I believe we are slowly building all the technologies we need to help us solve the problems. Furthermore, humans are adapting their behaviour for recent changes in social norms, and these adaptations may prove beneficial to establish a new society.
I will briefly describe the utopian society I dream of, and I believe this society will become a reality not with the use of force, or by any revolution. It will happen naturally. There is a famous quote often attributed to Stanislaw Jerzy Lec: “No snowflake in an avalanche ever felt responsible”. In the case of building a freer society, every individual will make conscious choices that promote freedom and will ultimately cause an avalanche that will not destroy us but will promote life instead.
Life in society creates many challenges. Individuals balance their individual priorities and collective priorities, according to each person’s moral values, which ideally would be aligned with community ethics. We should determine the most pressing issues and prioritise them. The Maslow hierarchy of needs could help to achieve such a goal. Society should prioritise physiological needs over safety needs. The latter should be prioritised over concerns on love and belonging. Similarly, these should be prioritised over the need for esteem. And lastly, this should be prioritised over the need for self-actualisation. 
When deciding between species, humans should have priority. Slowly society would discuss how to create a hierarchy for all living beings, potentially something like adapting the phylogenetic classification of species to determine which animals would receive more resources towards preserving them. 
The blockchain technology will be essential to advance freedom. It enables the free exchange of goods and services. It respects privacy; there is little risk of fraud; it is unregulated and relatively quick. Like other modern technologies, there is room for improvement, like making it even safer and processing transactions faster. These issues will be solved soon, as more people adopt the technology and employ their energy towards improving it. 
Blockchain may be used not only for trading but also to promote justice. Instead of using paper ballots and delegating all the power to politicians, the use of blockchain technology has the potential to substitute politicians as powerful rulers to mere executors. If every citizen could express their opinion on many subjects without the high cost of having an election, like most countries have today, this would shift power to the people, and take it away from politicians. The Athenian democracy, in ancient Greece, already followed a similar model. All citizens could vote, and the council was composed by bureaucrats who only executed what was decided by popular vote. It would be like automating the process and taking away jobs from politicians.
Justice has been and will always be something people consider essential when living in society. Justice serves four purposes. Two of them are related to the perpetrator of the injustice, and two of them are related to the community. The perpetrator, if found guilty, should be condemned to a punishment proportional to the severity of their actions. Justice helps the defendant to understand their moral failure, and ideally, it should encourage the defendant to avoid committing other immoral acts. Concerning society, justice demonstrates immoral actions should be discouraged, and it also prevents victims from seeking revenge. 
Furthermore, justice should apply the same rules for every citizen, following the principle of the rule of law. In a free society, Blockchain technology could help to create undisputed evidence on contracts, trades, and other information. Other technologies, like smartwatches capable of capturing vital signals, can also provide useful evidence. In the future smartwatches may even give additional information like serum levels of catecholamines and other neurotransmitters, and this would be a game-changer for the justice system. These systems have advantages over closed-circuit camera systems for preserving the right to privacy.
Multi-ethnic marriages are an example of how cultural behaviours may improve chances of survival. As it happens with other species, higher genetic variability produces offspring with more competent immune systems, and a lower risk of health impairments, such as cognitive difficulties, organ malformation, and other genetically inherited diseases. 
The way society sees health and diseases may also change. Today, healthcare professionals are focused on treating illnesses rather than promoting health. Maybe it has something to do with how we have created the incentives for them to do their job. If more resources were allocated in promoting health, as some doctors specialised in lifestyle medicine advocate, maybe we would see better outcomes. 
Another variable that should be considered is the size of the community. Living in megalopolis may bring some advantages, but it certainly carries significant disadvantages. Researchers have suggested that humans may have a limitation on the number of individuals they can process as part of their community. Some authors estimate the number at 150; therefore, living in communities with thousands of people may predispose us to behave sub-optimally. It is much easier to integrate and develop meaningful relationships in a smaller and more familiar environment than in a huge metropolis. The decision on how to organise communities should be made using critical thinking and respecting individual freedom. Nevertheless, the advantages of small communities are many. If many communities share common values, they may create treaties of free movement if individuals living in these communities believe it would be favourable.
Today, personal documents to prove one’s identity are essential. In the future, people may use blockchain technology to make the process less complicated. It may require the testimony of ten to 100 people to validate a diploma or alter any document registered to an individual’s blockchain ID. Friends and family should declare conflicts of interest and not participate in the validation.
Many of these changes would make a considerable impact on the value of assets and goods. This phenomenon is already taking place, as more and more people are selling their holiday houses and staying in short term rental properties. Some people are selling their cars and using alternative modes of transportation, which are paid by distance travelled or time used. This trend will intensify, and people will perceive more value in sharing an electric car than owning a fossil-fuel car. Every purchase works as a vote, creating incentives for people to invest in clean energy solutions. 
Each individual choice should be made with critical thinking. What are the alternatives to the chosen strategy? Wind and solar are not a reliable source of energy, as it requires many batteries to provide a continuous stream of energy. Nuclear power, on the other hand, has become much safer thanks to advancements in technology. We should weight our decisions aware of our personal biases. We already have the technology, but the systems in place make it harder for the shift to more environmentally-friendly solutions to become cost-effective and widely adopted. 

Chapter 12. Not over yet
After I came up with the thesis intending to explain the division of society we have experienced, I was living is pure ecstasy. It lasted for 24 hours. It felt like a true blessing. I was in peace. I had forgiven everybody whose opinions differed to mine. But after some reflection and additional research, I was able to expand my initial thoughts. 
The idea of extinction was very sad to me. When I thought about how grateful I felt for all wisdom transmitted by our ancestors, just imagining all this energy vanishing made me feel very upset. And then I realised some species are extinct while others flourish. It happened with other hominids who were competing against the Homo sapiens. So it probably will happen to our species, too. Suppose one population can develop a system that gives them a considerable advantage over other groups of individuals of the same species, and there is little exchange of genetic material between these populations for enough time. Then, the first population will evolve into a different species, while the second will remain as an ancestor of the first. If resources are scarce, the second species may become extinct, leaving only the first species to continue with the evolution process.
It then became clear to me. People who favoured public policies that continue to strip away people’s rights and freedom are just not aware that they are just following their instincts. They have made the subconscious decision to keep the wheel spinning, creating two different social classes, with hopes to be amongst the dominant class. Their strategy will ultimately end in speciation, which is the creation of a new species, followed by the extinction of the less privileged class living in their society, and, hopefully, any other community that values freedom.
What about societies who valued freedom? Aren’t they part of the evolution process, too? I took me a while to figure out the answer. Still, I managed to propose the following theory: The answer is yes, like any other animal on the planet, a society made by individuals who were aware of the chosen strategy and valued freedom would continue with the evolution process by carefully evaluating the decision to have kids. Some individuals would decide to leave no offspring. Other would have one child, some would have two children, and some would have numerous children. It is important to remember that this society also values education and the principle of non-aggression, which can be translated into the four cardinal virtues, which can be further explained by the seven heavenly virtues, and the process continues indefinitely to each particular situation. Today, the fertility rate necessary to maintain the population level stable is 2.1 in humans. The current fertility rate is 2.4, but it varies widely depending on the region. The pressing need to preserve natural resources may weight in during the process of deciding to pass on one’s genes. To some extent, this is already happening in some Scandinavian countries, where fertility rates varying from 1.4 (Finland) to 1.76 (Sweden). 
People often do not realise what factors shape their behaviours; some people don’t take much time to reflect and develop strategies to reach more successful outcomes carefully. Some people have designed their lives so much around the safety strategy, that even when they become aware of it, they maintain the chosen method. But this way of thinking falls into the sunk-cost fallacy, which is an argumentative fallacy that backs one strategy over another that is clearly more advantageous because much investment was made in adopting it. The sooner the individual realises he should accept their mistakes, throw away their initial investments, and start fresh, the sooner they will be back on track towards a more desirable outcome. Following one’s instincts of being a good person is the only path to a healthy communal living. If one individual consciously chooses the less virtuous path, it will be a matter of time for nature to show them that they made a mistake. It may take several years or even a lifetime. But their offspring will not be able to keep passing their genes if they follow the path of vice. One can get away with it for a short while, but as information becomes more and more available, they will soon be unmasked. 
I could have changed the hypothesis of this work, which was presented in chapter 6, to the following: “The acts motivated by goodness (a divine virtue) and the willingness to become closer to God motivates humans to promote life”. Even though it may be true in some readers’ hearts, it is incredibly difficult to measure goodness and proximity to God objectively. Perhaps one day, after other people have contributed to this thesis, this alternative hypothesis could be tested. 
The Israeli historian and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari wrote in August 2014: “History began when humans invented gods and will end when humans become gods” Perhaps attempting speciation is just one step in the process. 
I do not have the power to determine if the reader should choose my way or another way. If I genuinely believe in reason and my principles, I should allow the reader to decide freely. There will be consequences for either choice. The reader should weigh the consequences and choose freely. 

Chapter 13. References
Writing this book was very challenging. I tried to make my best to reference my claims properly, but it covers a wide range of topics, making it hard to point out all my sources. I am sure there will be fact-checkers disputing some of my claims, and I am ready to receive criticism because this is how science is made. Peer-reviewing is a fundamental step of the process. The reason I decided not to waste precious time to reference every statement properly is that I wanted to make these ideas public as soon as possible. I went through some level of suffering in 2020, and I believe some people are going through the same thing I was just two weeks before I started to write this book.
That being said, I am releasing this book publicly, but I will continue to work on improving it. The present text can be considered the first version of a book that will never be complete. I invite other authors who agree with some of my ideas to expand the knowledge in this book. Life is a journey, and the future is uncertain. That is the most exciting aspect of life. In the future people may interact with other humans in a completely different way compared to what I have proposed in this book. If that happens, the whole theory should be revised. If I am alive and well, I will do it myself. If I am long gone, I expect others to do it on my behalf. This position I adopted explains the title of the book. It does not require faith. It requires reason. I would be delighted to be proven wrong, and I would be happy to come up with another model to explain human behaviour. 
Many philosophers have inspired me to reach the conclusions I presented in this book. I am thankful for all my teachers and mentors; they were crucial to stimulate me to study and work hard. For a question of privacy, I will not disclose who my teachers were, but I can thank some authors who have passed away or who are public figures. I decided to preserve some authors due to the privacy issue, but if you have been promoting freedom publicly in the past ten years, you may have been one of my sources of inspiration. Thank you.
There are many scientific and cultural fields that inspired me to contribute towards human knowledge with the ideas presented in this book. My individual circumstances allowed me to pursue a more liveable future by becoming an investor. I started investing when I was 17, and I have made many mistakes, which led me to learn quite a lot on the subject. Basic understanding of economic theories was necessary to continue the investing process, and they fascinated me. The Austrian school of economics was a current of thought I came across during my journey to become a better investor. It is still relevant today, and I recommend people who value liberty to look for authors like Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Murray Rothbard, to name a few. I am also thankful for many authors from the Chicago school of economics, such as Frank Knight and Milton Friedman, as well as more recent economists like Thomas Sowell.
Classic philosophy was also another subject I have an interest in since I was 15 years old. I credit my parents for teaching me the importance of reading and understanding classical philosophy. I also thank an international organisation for assisting me in my first steps in this journey. It is called New Acropolis, and there are branches in most major cities in many countries. Unfortunately, I quit attending their lectures and meetings after a few years. But I am thankful for their teachings. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle also influenced me heavily. Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas contributed to the notion of how reason could lead help us understand the world and the role of a higher power, God, could play in our lives. Many philosophers from the Enlightenment Era such as Rene Descartes (in fact, a predecessor), John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Immanuel Kant, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rosseau, and David Hume inspired me. It was also essential for me to read Karl Marx, Nietzsche, John Rawls, Darwin, John Stuart Mill, George Orwell, Albert Camus, Franz Kafka, and Auguste Comte. I thank other authors who influenced the libertarianism movement, such as Ayn Rand, Noam Chomsky, Josiah Warren, and Bertrand Russell.
Some contemporary authors or creators have influenced me immensely. I thank the following people (in no particular order): Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, Dennis Prager, Ivor Cummins, Steven Crowder, Michael Knowles, Will Witt, the author of Three Arrows (History Baller?), Sam Harris, Slajov Zizek, Michael Sanders, among many others.
I will gradually work on providing clear links between the authors and each idea presented in the book. I am sure there are many ideas that have been proposed by other authors I have failed to acknowledge, but I will be happy to fix it with the valuable contribution of readers.

Chapter 14. Conspiracy Theory
This book would not be complete without addressing accusations of conspiracy theory. A critical element of any conspiracy theory is the belief that some covert but influential organisation is responsible for an unexplained event, according to the Oxford dictionary. The present hypothesis (humans are driven by freedom) fails to attribute recent events to a single organisation. Therefore, it immediately loses the conspiracy status, as it was based in science. As I have explained, the theory is considered satisfactory according to the scientific method when it defines a natural phenomenon well. I am confident that some critics will quote specific parts from this book with the objective of transforming it into a conspiracy theory. Their goal would be to take away the author’s credibility and to ridicule readers who understand the thesis and agree with its practical consequences. 
After making this important disclaimer, I must say I was influenced by some conspiracy theories, which have some elements of truth and some elements of fantasy. It is crucial to separate both if one is interested in finding the truth. 
Whenever I came across any form of conspiracy theory, or dogmatic religious belief, I immediately felt frustrated and lost all my interest on the topic. Most rational people act this way. And it is a good thing because science cannot advance based on conspiracy theories or dogmas. 
The most relevant theory was the Qanon. Mainstream media has been avid to inform their educated audience about the dangers of the conspiracy in the recent past. It was a conspiracy theory which considered the United States president Donald Trump the saviour of humanity. There are other elements of the theory that I did not look into because I believe Donald Trump is a human being like anybody else, and as such, he is gifted with free will. He may do good things and bad things. The moment he deviates from my individual principles, he will lose my support. 
Some people will create additional conspiracy theories to explain the president’s behaviour, but it is ultimately each individual’s job to look for the truth. No fact-checking agency can do this job for you. And if in doubt, it is always reasonable to presume innocence, until proven guilty. One may hide the truth from a few people for a long time, or hide the truth from many people for a short period, but it is impossible to hide the truth from many people for a long time. This idea was especially true in the past when the world was still moving forward towards freedom and progress. The moment society passed the turning point and decided to rebuild the fundamental pillars of our society with misinformation, pseudo-science, and propaganda. It became harder and harder to preserve the truth. But the truth will prevail because most people are attracted to it. And even if it becomes the minority, there will always be hope for individuals who are seeking the truth. As scientific knowledge advances in fields like psychology, it becomes easier to understand personality types, disorders, and propose changes in behaviour and techniques to shape one’s behaviour. In the future, it will be possible to optimise the flux of individuals between models of societies.

Epilogue
Personal identity
I have used a pen name to write this book. This decision was motivated by two reasons: The first reason is I do not need to take the credit for the work. I find it a small contribution to society. The only reward I could ever expect is to honour our ancestors and make a small contribution towards a freer and better life for future generations. Maybe some of this work can be credited to my reasoning and free will. Perhaps it was just an illusion, and some superior power has guided me. I do not have enough evidence to make this claim. 
The second reason is for safety concerns. The cancel culture has harmed many people. I do not fear corporate retaliation, but violence is one of my worries. However, if something happens to me, and the perpetrator of a possible attack is motivated by the ideas in this book, it will only prove I was right. 
August was a first name I chose inspired in Augustine of Hippo, whose work influenced many intellectuals and who used reason to show evidence of the existence of God. August was also a reference to the Roman emperor Cesar Augustus, who was a controversial leader. The ruled a civilisation with at least two different social classes: the upper and lower strata. Despite being an advanced society, slavery was a fundamental pillar of the Roman civilisation. M is a middle name initial that represents the year MMXX (2020). And Owl is an animal which represents wisdom. I recognise no other meanings or interpretations of my pen name. I have decided never to reveal my real identity, and I predict some people will try to claim authorship of this book, as it happened to Satoshi Nakamoto. None of them should be considered the author.
The Blockchain technology was created by an author who also used a pen name. Satoshi Nakamoto considered his creation a very powerful tool for humanity and decided not to take credit for the invention. His contribution shapes the life of many people worldwide, creating a freer world. I am thankful for his gift, and his example inspired me to do the same.

Paying it forward
Distributing this book for free was a decision I made to show I am not interested in recognition or being rewarded by any means. It also reflects the fact that I understand that people value their money, so charging a hefty price would restrict access. I also believe distributing it for free may diminish the perceived value by some readers. If you found this book helpful and would like to share it with friends and family, but you are afraid they will not be willing to waste their time by reading a free book, tell them the price of the book is US$ 7.99. I suggest people support the Mises Institute, which is a charity focused on teaching libertarian principles, especially the Austrian School of Economics to people interested. It has a maximum star rating at the Charity Navigator website. You can also support them by enrolling in an online course or making a more generous donation. The journey to a world with more freedom starts today.

Updates
This book is a work in progress, and I hope to receive constructive criticism to help me improve the thesis. I will keep all versions of the document on the website (http://www.augustmowl.com/), and if anyone wishes to contact me, please visit the official website or e-mail (augustmowl@gmail.com). I am publishing the book in several online editors which allow the distribution of books for free. I currently have no social media accounts, and I have no plans to create them. If other forms of communication are needed, they will be announced on the official website.
